class GradExpon(brainstate.nn.Module):
    r"""Accumulate gradients with an exponential (leaky) running sum.

    Maintains a decaying accumulator over a pytree of gradients, useful for
    smoothing online-learning gradient signals across time steps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grad_shape : PyTree
        A pytree whose leaves give the shape and dtype of the gradients to
        accumulate. The accumulator is initialised to zeros matching each
        leaf.
    tau_or_decay : brainunit.Quantity or float
        Either a decay time constant (as a :class:`~brainunit.Quantity`), from
        which the decay factor is computed as
        :math:`\exp(-1 / (\tau / \mathrm{dt}))`, or the decay factor itself
        (a ``float`` in the open interval :math:`(0, 1)`).

    Notes
    -----
    The update rule is

    .. math::

        g_{t+1} = \mathrm{decay} \cdot g_t + \mathrm{grads},

    where :math:`g_t` is the accumulated gradient at time :math:`t`,
    :math:`\mathrm{grads}` is the new gradient at time :math:`t`, and
    :math:`\mathrm{decay}` is the decay factor.

    Examples
    --------
    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import brainstate
        >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
        >>> import braintrace
        >>> acc = braintrace.GradExpon(jnp.zeros((3,)), 0.9)
        >>> acc.update(jnp.ones((3,)))
        >>> acc.update(jnp.ones((3,)))
        >>> print(acc.gradients.value)
