"""L3-C approximate-class correctness: direction-alignment metrics against BPTT
(cosine / sign / relative magnitude), the multi-state (num_state == 2) exactness
guard for D_RTRL, and the rate-model approximation-exactness ceiling
(F-21/F-22/F-23/F-29).

The OTTT/OTPE-specific bias tests (F-01/F-04/F-07/F-08/F-09) were removed in
