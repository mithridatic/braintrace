class ETraceGraphExecutor:
    r"""
    The eligibility trace graph executor.

    This class is used for computing the weight spatial gradients and the hidden state residuals.
    It is the most foundational class for the ETrace algorithms.

    It is important to note that the graph is built no matter whether the model is
    batched or not. This means that this graph can be applied to any kind of models.
    However, the compilation is sensitive to the shape of hidden states.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: brainstate.nn.Module
        The model to build the eligibility trace graph. The models should only define the one-step behavior.
    include_recurrent_mixing: bool, optional
        Hidden-group grouping mode for the hidden-to-hidden transition; see
        ``compile_etrace_graph(..., include_recurrent_mixing=...)``.
    sparse_n: int, optional
        SnAp order for ``recurrence_scope='sparse_n'``; each hidden group then
        carries the derived n-step neighbourhood its trace is widened onto.
        ``None`` (default) for every other scope.
    snap_max_jacobian_elements: int, optional
        Maximum number of elements in any materialized full hidden Jacobian or
        widened sparse block Jacobian.
    control_flow: ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Policy governing control-flow canonicalization (cond if-conversion,
        scan unrolling, structured scan descent, ...) during graph
        compilation. ``None`` (default) uses
        ``ControlFlowPolicy()``.
