    """Add a second-pass parameter-gradient tree, skipping ETP-routed paths.

    The plain parameters need the future cotangent -- it is the credit their
    truncated window threw away, and adding it makes the sum over windows
    telescope. The ETP-routed ones must not get it: their cross-window credit is
    already carried by the eligibility trace, so adding it here would count the
    same path twice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base : dict or None

    future : dict or None

    Raises
    ------
    KeyError
        If ``future`` carries a path ``base`` does not. Both trees are unflattened
        from the *same* ``in_tree``, so their key sets are identical by
        construction and this cannot happen. It is checked rather than skipped
        because the failure mode would be silent: a dropped path loses exactly the
        cross-window credit this function exists to deliver, and every one of

        first implementation.

    The backward pass hands back a collection of hidden-state cotangents which

    downstream re-derives which hidden state a given cotangent came from, so a
    mis-ordered or mis-shaped collection produces a **wrong gradient rather than
    an error**. This function is the contract that makes that impossible.

    Three things are checked, for every hidden group and every position in it:

    1. **Totality** -- every path a group needs is present in
       ``path_to_cotangent``.
    2. **No strays** -- ``path_to_cotangent`` carries no path that no group
       claims, which would mean the cotangent collection and the compiled graph
       describe different models.
    3. **Correspondence** -- the cotangent at each path has the shape and dtype
       of the hidden state at that path (see :func:`_expected_hidden_shape`),
       compared after :func:`brainunit.get_mantissa`, exactly as the consumers
       strip units before concatenating.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hidden_groups : sequence of HiddenGroup
        The compiled hidden groups the cotangents will be routed onto.
    path_to_cotangent : dict
        Mapping from hidden-state path to that state's cotangent.
    source : str
        Human-readable name of the branch that produced ``path_to_cotangent``,
        used in the error messages so the reader is not left guessing which of
        the two VJP modes failed.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any of the three conditions above does not hold. The message names
        the hidden group, the position within it, the path, and the expected
        versus actual shape/dtype.

    Notes
    -----
    Deliberately ``if ... raise`` and not ``assert``: ``python -O`` /
    ``PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1`` strips ``assert`` statements, and this guard has to
    hold on an optimised interpreter too.

    Every comparison is on Python-level metadata -- dict keys, static shapes,
    dtypes -- and never on array *data*. Nothing here is traced into the
    compiled program, so it adds no XLA operation and forces no device sync,
    even though it runs once per backward pass.

    r"""Expand a modulatory signal to one hidden group's signal shape.

    Implements the ``learning_signal='modulatory'`` broadcasting contract. It is
    deliberately *not* bare NumPy broadcasting: NumPy aligns trailing axes, so a
    ``(1, n_rec)`` modulator does **not** broadcast to a ``(1, n_rec, 1)``
    signal -- it would raise, or worse, silently align ``n_rec`` against the
    state axis when ``num_state == n_rec``. The contract, matching AGENTS.md's
    SNN learning-signal trailing-axis rule:

    * A scalar is broadcast to the whole group shape;
    * A modulator shaped exactly like the group's ``varshape`` gains a trailing
      size-1 state axis first, then broadcasts;
    * Anything else must broadcast against ``(*varshape, num_state)`` as given.

    The expansion is driven only by shapes, never by group index or group count.
    A scalar reward is therefore valid for any model whatever its HiddenGroup
    count, which is the property that keeps this axis general (roadmap risk 5).

    Parameters
    ----------
    modulator : array_like or Quantity
        The user-supplied signal. A ``list`` or ``tuple`` is refused: see Raises.
    group_shape : tuple of int

class ETraceVjpAlgorithm(ETraceAlgorithm):
    r"""Provide VJP-based eligibility-trace gradient computation.

    The term ``VJP`` comes from two aspects. First, this module is designed to be
    compatible with JAX's VJP mechanism, so the gradient is computed according to the
    reverse-mode differentiation interface, like ``jax.grad``, ``jax.vjp``, or
    ``jax.jacrev``. The true update function is defined as a custom VJP function
    ``._true_update_fun()``, which receives the inputs, the hidden states, other states,
    and etrace variables at the last time step, and returns the outputs, the hidden
    states, other states, and etrace variables at the current time step. Second, the
    algorithm computes the spatial gradient :math:`\partial L^t / \partial H^t` using the
    standard back-propagation algorithm, which enhances the accuracy and the stability of
    the gradient computation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The model function, which receives the input arguments and returns the model output.
    name : str, optional
        The name of the etrace algorithm.
    vjp_method : str, optional
        The method for computing the VJP. It should be either ``"single-step"`` or
        ``"multi-step"``. Default is ``"single-step"``.

        - ``"single-step"``: The VJP is computed at the current time step, i.e.,
          :math:`\partial L^t/\partial h^t`.
        - ``"multi-step"``: The VJP is computed at multiple time steps, i.e.,
          :math:`\partial L^t/\partial h^{t-k}`, where :math:`k` is determined by the
          data input.
    control_flow : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Policy governing control-flow canonicalization (cond if-conversion,
        scan unrolling, structured scan descent, ...) during graph
        compilation. ``None`` (default) uses
        ``ControlFlowPolicy()``.
    config : ETraceConfig, optional
        Learning-rule coordinates. ``None`` uses the subclass's preset
        coordinate.
    random_feedback_key : jax.Array, optional
        Key used to initialize fixed random-feedback projections when
        ``config.learning_signal='random_feedback'``.
    snap_max_jacobian_elements : int, optional
        Maximum number of elements permitted in a materialized full hidden
        Jacobian or widened sparse block Jacobian. The default is ``16777216``.

    Notes
    -----
    For each subclass (or the instance of an etrace algorithm), the following methods
    define the custom VJP rule:

    - ``._update()``: update the eligibility trace states and return the outputs, hidden
      states, other states, and etrace data.
    - ``._update_fwd()``: the forward pass of the custom VJP rule.
    - ``._update_bwd()``: the backward pass of the custom VJP rule.

    This class provides a default implementation for the ``._update()``,
    ``._update_fwd()``, and ``._update_bwd()`` methods. To implement a new etrace
    algorithm, users just need to override the following methods:

    - ``._solve_weight_gradients()``: solve the gradients of the learnable weights / parameters.
    - ``._update_etrace_data()``: update the eligibility trace data.
    - ``._assign_etrace_data()``: assign the eligibility trace data to the states.
    - ``._get_etrace_data()``: get the eligibility trace data.

        has no such position, so the widened representation is not merely

        jacobians : sequence of jax.Array
            The executor's per-hidden-group hidden-to-hidden Jacobians. Reached
            two ways: as the executor's return value on the non-fused path, and
            as the stepper's per-step argument on the fused one (see

        Notes
        -----
        The substitution differs per engine, and the difference is load-bearing.
        Under ``per_param`` the roll is ``eps <- D @ eps + instant``, so a leak
        must be carried by the substituted array itself (``lam * I``). Under
        ``io_factorized`` the f-side applies ``D`` first and *then* smooths by
        ``alpha_f``, so substituting ``lam * I`` there would yield
        ``alpha_f * lam`` — an accidental ``alpha_f ** 2``. The f-side leak
        already lives in ``alpha_f``, so its substitution is the bare identity.

        Replacements are built from ``D.shape``, never from a fixed rank: the
        leading axes vary by path — ``(*varshape, S, S)`` single-step,
        ``(T, *varshape, S, S)`` stacked multi-step, and ``(L, *varshape, S, S)``

        """Return a per-step eligibility-trace update callback, or ``None``.

        When a subclass can express its trace roll as a pure step function with
        signature ``(etrace_carry, (x_dict, df_dict, diag_list)) -> (new_carry, None)``,
        it should override this to return that callback (typically the same
        ``partial`` it builds inside :meth:`_update_etrace_data`). For multi-step
        input the graph executor then fuses the roll into its over-time scan,
        eliminating the separate trace scan and the stacked per-step Jacobians.

        Returning ``None`` (the default) keeps the legacy two-pass behavior: the
        executor stacks the Jacobians and :meth:`_update_etrace_data` rolls the
        trace in a second scan. Subclasses whose update cannot be written as such a
        step function (or that do not support multi-step input) leave this ``None``.

        ----------
