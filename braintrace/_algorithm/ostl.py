"""OSTL — Online Spatio-Temporal Learning (Bohnstingl et al. 2023).

The paper defines two regimes that differ in whether the recurrent (hidden-to-
hidden) Jacobian ``H`` is retained. Each regime is its own class so that it
inherits the full, separately-tested machinery of an existing VJP algorithm —
``compile_graph``, ``update``, ``reset_state``, ``get_etrace_of`` — without
branching:

- :class:`OSTLRecurrent` ('with-H') keeps ``H`` and is RTRL-exact for a single
  recurrent layer *whose hidden-to-hidden Jacobian is block-diagonal* (i.e. the
  only path from one hidden unit to another is through a traced ETP recurrent
  weight, not e.g. a hand-written mixing term) — per-parameter D-RTRL trace,
  O(P·H). Genuine cross-hidden-unit coupling outside the traced weight is
  dropped, so the rule is then only an approximation to BPTT.
- :class:`OSTLFeedforward` ('without-H') drops ``H``; the temporal term vanishes
  and the update reduces to pp_prop with negligible decay (feedforward SNN).

class OSTLRecurrent(ParamDimVjpAlgorithm):
    r"""OSTL 'with-H' regime — single-layer factorization, RTRL-exact only for block-diagonal hidden-to-hidden Jacobians.

    OSTL [1]_ derives an online rule by cleanly separating the gradient into a
    *temporal* eligibility trace and a *spatial* learning signal. The 'with-H'
    regime retains the hidden-to-hidden Jacobian, so the trace carries the full
    temporal term:

    .. math::

        \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^t = \mathbf{D}^t\,\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{t-1}
        + \operatorname{diag}(\mathbf{D}_f^t)\otimes \mathbf{x}^t ,
        \qquad
        \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mathcal{L}
        = \sum_t \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^t}{\partial \mathbf{h}^t}
          \circ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^t ,

    where :math:`\mathbf{D}^t` is the hidden-to-hidden Jacobian, :math:`\mathbf{D}_f^t`
    the state-to-output Jacobian, and :math:`\mathbf{x}^t` the presynaptic input.
    This is exactly the per-parameter D-RTRL trace (memory :math:`O(P\cdot H)`),
    so the class delegates entirely to :class:`~braintrace.ParamDimVjpAlgorithm`.

    **Accuracy caveat.** The D-RTRL trace machinery underlying this class only
    ever retains the per-position *block-diagonal* of :math:`\mathbf{D}^t`
    (:func:`HiddenGroup.diagonal_jacobian`, via ``block_diagonal_last_dim``):
    Cross-hidden-unit terms :math:`\partial h^t_p / \partial h^{t-1}_q` for
    :math:`p \ne q` are retained only insofar as they flow through a *traced
    ETP weight* (e.g. a recurrent :func:`~braintrace.matmul`); any other
    hidden-to-hidden mixing (e.g. a hand-written convolution/roll/mixing term
    not expressed as an ETP op) is *not* captured. Consequently the rule is
    gradient-equivalent to BPTT only when the hidden-to-hidden Jacobian is
    (effectively) block-diagonal in this sense — for a single recurrent layer
    whose only cross-unit coupling is the traced ETP recurrent weight, the two
    coincide to machine precision. If some other part of the model couples
    hidden units directly (bypassing the traced weight), the two diverge; see
    ``TestOSTLRecurrentVsBPTT`` in ``ostl_test.py`` for a worked example of both
    regimes.

    Parameters

    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The recurrent SNN whose weights are trained online.
    name : str, optional
        Name of the algorithm instance.

    control_flow : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Control-flow canonicalization policy used during graph compilation.
    config : ETraceConfig, optional
        Learning-rule coordinates. ``None`` uses the OSTL recurrent preset.

class OSTLFeedforward(pp_prop):
    r"""OSTL 'without-H' regime — feedforward / no recurrent Jacobian.

    The 'without-H' regime drops the hidden-to-hidden Jacobian
    :math:`\mathbf{D}^t`, so the temporal term of the eligibility trace
    vanishes and only the instantaneous (spatial) contribution survives:

    .. math::

        \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^t \approx \operatorname{diag}(\mathbf{D}_f^t)
        \otimes \mathbf{x}^t ,
        \qquad
        \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mathcal{L}
        = \sum_t \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^t}{\partial \mathbf{h}^t}
          \circ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^t .

    This is the appropriate approximation for feed-forward SNNs in the OSTL
    construction [1]_. It is realized by delegating to
    :class:`~braintrace.pp_prop` (the input-output factorized trace) with a
    *negligible* decay, so the trace does not accumulate across time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The SNN whose weights are trained online.
    decay_or_rank : float or int, default 1e-6
        Exponential-smoothing factor of the IO-dim trace. The tiny default makes
        the temporal contribution negligible, matching the 'without-H' regime. A
        float must lie in ``[0, 1)``; an int is read as an approximation rank.
    name : str, optional
        Name of the algorithm instance.
    **kwargs : Any
        Additional options forwarded to :class:`~braintrace.pp_prop`, including
        ``vjp_method``, ``fast_solve``, ``control_flow``, ``config``, and
        ``random_feedback_key``.

    Notes
    -----
    The default ``1e-6`` is *negligible*, not zero, so in axis terms the
    coordinate is ``temporal_recursion=('scalar_leak', 'jacobian')`` with a tiny
    coefficient — both recursion terms are structurally present. The exact
    ``temporal_recursion='none'`` coordinate is ``decay_or_rank=0.0`` (or
    equivalently ``decay_or_rank=1``, since rank 1 maps to decay 0). The default
    is left at ``1e-6`` because changing it would move this preset's gradients.
