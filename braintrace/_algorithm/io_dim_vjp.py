    Determines the decay factor and the number of approximation ranks based on the input.

    This function takes either a decay factor or many approximation ranks as input
    and returns both the decay factor and the number of approximation ranks. If the input
    is a float, it is treated as a decay factor, and the number of ranks is calculated.
    If the input is an integer, it is treated as the number of ranks, and the decay factor
    is calculated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    decay_or_rank : float or int
        The decay factor (a float in ``[0, 1)``) or the number of approximation
        ranks (a positive integer).

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of (float, int)

        If the decay is not finite and in ``[0, 1)``, or the rank is less than

    -----
    The lower bound is inclusive so that ``temporal_recursion='none'`` is

class IODimVjpAlgorithm(ETraceVjpAlgorithm):
    r"""Online gradient algorithm with diagonal approximation and input-output-dimension complexity.

    This algorithm computes the gradients of the weights with the diagonal
    approximation and the input-output dimensional complexity. It implements
    the input/output-factorized estimator of Wang et al. [1]_ on the RTRL
    foundation of Williams and Zipser [2]_.

    Parameter routing is path-granular and exclusive. Paths owned by compiled
    ETP relations receive eligibility-trace gradients, while plain-only paths
    receive exact reverse-mode gradients for the current VJP window. Compilation
    rejects a ParamState whose pytree leaves participate in both categories.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The model function, which receives the input arguments and returns the
        model output. Its ETP-routed and plain-only parameter paths follow the
        routing contract described above.
    decay_or_rank : float, int, or tuple of two floats or ints
        Parameterization of the exponential smoothing factor. A float in
        :math:`[0, 1)` is used directly as the decay. A positive integer
        :math:`r` is converted to :math:`\alpha=(r-1)/(r+1)`. The integer form
        does not allocate :math:`r` separate trace factors; both forms use the
        same input/output-factorized trace structure. A two-item tuple
        configures the input- and output-side factors separately.
    name : str, optional
        Name of the eligibility-trace algorithm.
    vjp_method : str, optional
        The method for computing the VJP. It should be either ``"single-step"``
        or ``"multi-step"``.

        - ``"single-step"``: the VJP is computed at the current time step, i.e.,
          :math:`\partial L^t/\partial h^t`.
        - ``"multi-step"``: the VJP is computed at multiple time steps, i.e.,
          :math:`\partial L^t/\partial h^{t-k}`, where :math:`k` is determined by
          the data input.
    fast_solve : bool, optional
        Whether to use the closed-form per-primitive contractions when
        available. The default is ``True``.
    control_flow : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Policy governing control-flow canonicalization (cond if-conversion,
        scan unrolling, structured scan descent, ...) during graph
        compilation. ``None`` (default) uses
        ``ControlFlowPolicy()``.
    config : ETraceConfig, optional
        Learning-rule coordinates. ``None`` uses the input/output-factorized
        preset derived from ``decay_or_rank``.
    random_feedback_key : jax.Array, optional
        Key used to initialize fixed random-feedback projections when the
        selected config requests them.
    snap_max_jacobian_elements : int, optional
        Maximum number of elements in a materialized hidden Jacobian.

    Notes
    -----
    The learning rule is

    .. math::

        \begin{aligned}
        & \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^t \approx \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{f}}^t \otimes \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{x}}^t \\
        & \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{x}}^t=\alpha \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{x}}^{t-1}+\mathbf{x}^t \\
        & \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{f}}^t=\alpha \operatorname{diag}\left(\mathbf{D}^t\right) \circ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{f}}^{t-1}+(1-\alpha) \operatorname{diag}\left(\mathbf{D}_f^t\right) \\
        & \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \mathcal{L}=\sum_{t^{\prime} \in \mathcal{T}} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^{t^{\prime}}}{\partial \mathbf{h}^{t^{\prime}}} \circ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{t^{\prime}}
        \end{aligned}

    where :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{x}}^t` is the input-side trace,
    :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{f}}^t` the output-side trace,
    :math:`\alpha` the exponential-smoothing factor, :math:`\mathbf{D}^t` the
    hidden-to-hidden Jacobian, :math:`\mathbf{D}_f^t` the state-to-output
    Jacobian, and :math:`\mathbf{x}^t` the presynaptic input.

    :math:`\mathbf{D}_f^t` is read off by
    ``ETraceVjpGraphExecutor._compute_hid2weight_jacobian``
    from a single all-ones-tangent ``jax.jvp`` of the ``y -> hidden`` map; see
    that method's docstring for when this is exact (elementwise maps) versus
    an approximation (non-elementwise maps, e.g. a normalization layer
    between the weight op and the neuron) — the same approximation is shared
    with :class:`~braintrace._algorithm.param_dim_vjp.ParamDimVjpAlgorithm`
    (``D_RTRL``).

    The full per-parameter D-RTRL trace
    :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^t \in \mathbb{R}^{I\times O}` is approximated by
    the outer product of two exponentially-smoothed *vectors* — one over the
    input dimension and one over the output dimension. Storing the two factors
    instead of the full matrix drops the memory from :math:`O(I\cdot O)` to
    :math:`O(I+O)` per layer. The decay :math:`\alpha` (or its integer
    parameterization) controls how much temporal history the factored trace
    retains; the bias of the exponential estimator is corrected at solve time.

    This algorithm has :math:`O(BI+BO)` memory complexity and :math:`O(BIO)`
    computational complexity, where :math:`I` and :math:`O` are the number of
    input and output dimensions, and :math:`B` the batch size. In particular, for
    a linear transformation layer, the weight gradients are computed with
    :math:`O(Bn)` memory complexity and :math:`O(Bn^2)` computational complexity,
    where :math:`n` is the number of hidden dimensions.

    For more details, please see `the ES-D-RTRL algorithm presented in our manuscript <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.24.614728v2>`_.
