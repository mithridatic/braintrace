"""Sequence drivers: run a compiled learner over a sequence.

Spec: ``docs/specs/2026-07-27-sequence-driver-api.md``.

This is a *composition* layer. It owns the loop, the gradient accumulator and
the loss reduction; it owns no numerics. The model call stays in the caller's
``step_fn``, because that call is where the eligibility trace advances and
hiding it would hide the subject of the library.

Two encodings are load-bearing and easy to get wrong silently:

- ``chunk_size=1`` is the **plain** path, matching ``dni._as_window``. Window
  mode starts at ``k >= 2``. A user who fits a synthesiser at
  ``train_synthetic_gradient(chunk_size=1)`` and drives at
  ``etrace_grad(chunk_size=1)`` must be right to believe they matched (F-35).
- ``mask`` gates the **loss only**. The learner is driven at every step, so a
  zero-weighted step still shapes the trace that later weighted steps consume.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *sequences
            One or more pytrees whose leaves share a leading length ``T``,
            sliced in lockstep and passed to ``step_fn`` positionally. There is
            no distinguished ``targets`` argument. May not be a
            :class:`SingleStepData` / :class:`MultiStepData` wrapper -- wrap
            inside ``step_fn`` instead.
        step_fn : callable
            The user's step function, which **runs the model itself** and
            returns the loss. Keyword-only and required. It must call this
            learner exactly once per invocation: zero calls leave the trace
            un-advanced for that step, two advance it twice, and neither is
            detectable from the returned gradient.
        mask : array, optional
            ``(T,)`` per-step loss weights; ``None`` means all-ones. Values need
            not be binary. Gates **only** the loss -- the model and the
            eligibility trace are driven at every step regardless.
        chunk_size : int, optional
            ``None`` (default) or ``1`` drive step-by-step, handing ``seq[t]``
            to ``step_fn``, which returns a scalar. ``k >= 2`` drives in
            windows, handing ``seq[t:t+k]`` of shape ``(k, ...)``, and
            ``step_fn`` must return a ``(k,)`` vector of per-step losses and
            wrap its model inputs in :class:`MultiStepData`. Window mode
            requires ``vjp_method='multi-step'`` and ``T % k == 0``, and is not
            available under a vmapped learner.
        weights : dict, optional
            The :class:`brainstate.ParamState` to differentiate. Defaults to
            the learner's own ``param_states``.
        reduction : {'mean', 'sum'}, optional
            ``'mean'`` (default) divides by the **total mask weight**,
            ``max(sum_t mask_t, 1)``, not by ``T``.
        loss_output : {'per_step', 'masked', 'scalar'}, optional
            What ``return_value=True`` hands back: the raw pre-mask losses
            ``(T,)``, the masked losses ``(T,)``, or the reduced objective
            (scalar). Ignored when ``return_value=False``.
        has_aux : bool, optional
            Whether ``step_fn`` returns ``(loss, aux)``.
        return_value : bool, optional
            Whether to return the losses alongside the gradients.

        Returns
        -------
        grads or tuple
            Mirrors ``brainstate.transform.grad``: ``grads``,
            ``(grads, losses)``, ``(grads, aux)`` or ``(grads, losses, aux)``.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If ``step_fn`` is not given; if *chunk_size* is not ``None`` or a
            Python ``int`` (a traced or numpy value is refused, since the value
            has to be known at trace time); or if a sequence is a
            :class:`SingleStepData` / :class:`MultiStepData` wrapper. The
            wrappers are registered pytree nodes, so slicing one would
            decompose the wrapper rather than the data.
        ValueError
            If no sequences are given, if their leading lengths disagree, or if
            ``T == 0`` -- there is nothing to slice. If *chunk_size* is below
            ``1``; if ``k >= 2`` but the learner's ``vjp_method`` is not
            ``'multi-step'`` (the executor would raise three frames down), the
            learner is vmapped (``in_axes=0`` would map time as the batch
            axis), or ``T % k != 0``. If *mask* is not shape ``(T,)``. If
            *reduction* or *loss_output* is not one of its legal values. If
            ``step_fn`` returns a non-scalar in plain mode, or anything but
            shape ``(k,)`` in window mode. If the learner has not been
            compiled, the existing guard raises before any of these.

        Warnings
        --------
        Two known limitations are *reachable through this method*. Neither is a
        driver defect -- both belong to the engines it drives -- but
        ``chunk_size`` is what makes them easy to hit by accident, so they are
        named here rather than only in the limitations document.

        **Window trace age.** ``running_index`` records completed timesteps, so
        a ``k``-step window advances it by ``k``. IO-factorized learners use
        that completed-step count for their f-trace warm-up correction.

        **F-35, DNI and the synthesizer's deployment contract.** A
        :func:`train_synthetic_gradient` fit is valid only for the exact
        ``(loss_fn, chunk_size)`` pair it was trained on, and **nothing checks
        that deployment matches**. Fit and drive at the same ``chunk_size`` --
        note that ``1`` and ``None`` are the same path on both sides. A mismatch
        is not degraded DNI but noise shaped like a cotangent: fitting at ``1``
        and deploying at ``2`` moves the gradient 2.0e-02 relative. ``mask`` is
        the other half of the contract, since it changes the objective the
        synthesizer is predicting the future of. ``reduction`` is **not**: it
        divides once after the loop and never enters the differentiated
        objective.

        Notes
        -----
        ``grads`` is the learner's **online-gradient estimate** of the reduced
        objective, not in general its mathematical derivative. For an exact
        algorithm inside its valid regime the two coincide; for every
        approximate rule they deliberately do not, and that difference is the
        algorithm's content. ``reduction`` and ``mask`` define the objective the
        estimate is *aimed at*.

        and every term is complete at its own timestep -- no term refers to a
        later step. :meth:`etrace_grad` computes those terms and adds them into
        an accumulator, applying one update once the sequence ends; this method
        computes the same terms and hands each one to ``optimizer`` as it is
        produced. Step ``t + 1`` therefore runs under parameters that step ``t``
        already moved, which is the regime an eligibility-trace algorithm exists
        for and which no accumulate-then-update path can express.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *sequences
            As in :meth:`etrace_grad`.
        step_fn : callable
            As in :meth:`etrace_grad`. Keyword-only and required.
        optimizer : braintools.optim.Optimizer
            Optimizer holding the trainable weights, already registered against
            them. Called once per updating step, inside the compiled loop.
        mask : array, optional
            ``(T,)`` per-step weights; ``None`` means all-ones. **Gates the
            update as well as the loss**, unlike :meth:`etrace_grad` where it
            gates the loss alone -- see the note below. Values need not be
            binary, and a nonzero weight scales that step's gradient exactly as
            it does there.
        chunk_size : int, optional
            As in :meth:`etrace_grad`, and here it is the update-frequency
            knob: ``k`` steps produce one gradient and one update. A window
            updates when any step in it carries nonzero weight.
        weights : dict, optional
            The :class:`brainstate.ParamState` to differentiate. Defaults to
            the learner's own ``param_states``. Must be the weights
            ``optimizer`` was registered against.
        transform : callable, optional
            Applied to the gradient pytree before the optimizer sees it, e.g.
            ``lambda g: brainstate.nn.clip_grad_norm(g, 1.0)``. An online run
            applies hundreds of updates per sequence rather than one, so
            clipping is rarely optional, and the loop is compiled -- a caller
            cannot reach inside it.
        has_aux : bool, optional
            Whether ``step_fn`` returns ``(loss, aux)``.
        return_value : bool, optional
            Whether to return the per-step losses.

        Returns
        -------
        None, losses, aux, or a tuple
            ``None`` by default; the raw pre-mask losses ``(T,)`` when
            ``return_value=True``; ``aux`` when ``has_aux=True``; both, as
            ``(losses, aux)``, when both are set.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If ``step_fn`` or ``optimizer`` is not given, or as in
            :meth:`etrace_grad` for *chunk_size* and wrapped sequences.
        ValueError
            As in :meth:`etrace_grad`.

        Notes
        -----
        **A zero-weight step performs no update at all.** In
        :meth:`etrace_grad` a zero weight only zeroes that step's contribution
        to a sum, which is a true no-op. Here it would not be: a stateful
        optimizer given an identically zero gradient still decays its moment
        estimates and still takes a step from surviving momentum. On a sequence
        whose supervised window is a fraction of its length, that momentum
        bleed would outweigh the learning signal. So a zero-weight step drives
        the model and advances the eligibility trace exactly as it does in
        :meth:`etrace_grad`, and leaves the parameters and the optimizer state
        untouched.

        There is no ``reduction``. It divides an accumulated gradient by the
        total mask weight, and there is no accumulator here to divide. Losses
        come back unreduced.

        step_fn : callable, optional
            ``None`` (default) calls the learner directly with the slices --
            and, under window mode, wraps them in :class:`MultiStepData`, since
            with no ``step_fn`` every sequence is by definition a model input.
            Supplying a ``step_fn`` opts out of that wrapping entirely.
        chunk_size : int, optional
            As in :meth:`etrace_grad`, **except** that windows are legal on
            either ``vjp_method``: this method runs no loss VJP, which is the
            only thing single-step learners refuse.
        return_outputs : bool, optional
            ``False`` (default) returns ``None`` and stacks nothing, so a long
            warm-up costs no output memory. ``True`` stacks whatever the call
            returned, with leading axis ``T // chunk_size``.

        None or stacked outputs
            ``None`` when ``return_outputs=False``; otherwise the stacked

            refused for being on a single-step learner -- no loss VJP is taken
