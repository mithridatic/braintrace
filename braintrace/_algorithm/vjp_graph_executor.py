    r"""
    The eligibility trace graph executor for the VJP-based online learning algorithms.

    This class is used for executing the eligibility trace graph for the VJP-based online learning algorithms,
    including:

    - :class:`pp_prop` (aliases ``ES_D_RTRL`` /
      :class:`IODimVjpAlgorithm`) for the
      algorithm with input-output dimensional complexity.
    - :class:`ParamDimVjpAlgorithm` (alias :class:`D_RTRL`) for the algorithm with
      parameter dimensional complexity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The model to build the eligibility trace graph. The models should only define the one-step behavior.
    vjp_method : str, optional
        The method for computing the VJP. It should be either ``"single-step"`` or
        ``"multi-step"``. Default is ``"single-step"``.

        - ``"single-step"``: The VJP is computed at the current time step, i.e.,
          :math:`\partial L^t/\partial h^t`.
        - ``"multi-step"``: The VJP is computed at multiple time steps, i.e.,
          :math:`\partial L^t/\partial h^{t-k}`, where :math:`k` is determined by the
          data input.
    include_recurrent_mixing : bool, optional
        Hidden-group grouping mode for the hidden-to-hidden transition; see
        ``compile_etrace_graph(..., include_recurrent_mixing=...)``.
    sparse_n : int, optional
        SnAp order for ``recurrence_scope='sparse_n'``. Default ``None``.
    snap_max_jacobian_elements : int, optional
        Maximum number of elements in a materialized full hidden Jacobian or
        widened sparse block Jacobian.
    control_flow : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Policy governing control-flow canonicalization during graph
        compilation. ``None`` (default) uses
        ``ControlFlowPolicy()``.
    full_jacobian : bool, optional
        Return each group's **full** ``(*varshape, S, *varshape, S)``
        hidden-to-hidden Jacobian instead of its per-position block diagonal.
        Only ``trace_factorization='random_projection'`` consumes this: a rank-1
        estimator of an already-block-diagonal recursion would be strictly worse
        than the recursion itself, so UORO rolls the whole transition. Default
        ``False``.

        Notes
        -----
        ``df`` is read off with a single all-ones-tangent :func:`jax.jvp` of
        each relation's ``y -> hidden group`` map (see the ``[ KEY ]`` comment
        in the loop body below). This is *exact* when that map is elementwise
        — the common case where an ETP op output feeds exactly one neuron —
        because the all-ones jvp then returns the map's Jacobian diagonal.

        When a non-elementwise op sits between the weight op and the hidden
        state (e.g. ``conv -> LayerNorm -> IF``), the true ``dh/dy`` is not
        diagonal and the all-ones jvp instead returns its *row sums*. Both
        :class:`~braintrace._algorithm.param_dim_vjp.ParamDimVjpAlgorithm`
        (``D_RTRL``) and
        :class:`~braintrace._algorithm.io_dim_vjp.IODimVjpAlgorithm`
        (``pp_prop`` / ``ES_D_RTRL``) consume this ``df`` as their
        :math:`\\mathbf{D}_f^t` term, so the approximation is shared by both
        algorithm families: for a mean-subtracting (shift-invariant) op the
        row sums happen to be exactly zero — the correct answer, since such
        an op has no eligibility gradient to give upstream — but a
        variance-style normalization computed with ``use_fast_variance=True``
        leaves a small float32 residual instead of an exact zero, which
        downstream recurrence/solve contractions can amplify. Prefer
        ``use_fast_variance=False`` on any normalization layer that feeds an
        ETP-traced op.

        Solving the hidden-to-weight and hidden-to-hidden Jacobian according to the given inputs and parameters.

        This function is typically used for computing the forward propagation of hidden-to-weight Jacobian.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args
            The positional arguments for the model.
        etrace_stepper : Callable, optional
            A per-step eligibility-trace update callback with signature
            ``(etrace_carry, (x_dict, df_dict, diag_list)) -> (new_carry, None)``.
            When provided together with multi-step input, the trace roll is fused
            into the model-forward scan (single loop, no stacked Jacobians) and the
            final trace is returned in the last slot. When ``None`` (default), the
            per-step Jacobians are stacked and returned as before.
        init_etrace : Any, optional
            The initial eligibility-trace carry, threaded through the scan when
            ``etrace_stepper`` is given. Ignored otherwise.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            The outputs, hidden states, other states, the spatial gradients of the
            weights, the hidden-to-hidden Jacobian, and the final eligibility trace.
            When ``etrace_stepper`` is given the two Jacobian slots are ``None`` and
            the last slot holds the fused trace; otherwise the last slot is ``None``.
            Return the single-step results if inputs do not contain multiple-step data,
            otherwise return the multi-step data.

        This function is typically used for computing both the forward propagation of hidden-to-weight Jacobian

            The outputs, hidden states, other states, the spatial gradients of the
