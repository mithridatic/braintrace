"""Gradient correctness on realistic SNN models: multi-timescale synapses,
per-neuron heterogeneous leaks, multi-state HiddenGroups, and E/I populations.

These are the claims ``AGENTS.md`` carried only as prose ("heterogeneous-
population leak resolution", "multi-state HiddenGroups"). They are discharged
here as passing tests rather than as fixes -- the compiler already handles them.

Assertion paths, per F-23: an *exact* algorithm versus BPTT uses the full-window
multi-step path, whose subject is the compiler and the ETP per-primitive rules
and which is the right instrument for that. Anything comparing *across*
algorithms uses a finite window.
