"""DNI -- Decoupled Neural Interfaces / synthetic gradients (Jaderberg et al., 2017).

A truncated window throws away the cotangent that would have arrived at its exit
from the future. For the ETP parameters that loss is already made good: the
eligibility trace carries their cross-window credit forward, which is what a trace
is *for*. For every **plain** parameter -- an input projection, a readout, anything
not routed through an ETP primitive -- it is simply lost, and no trace exists to
recover it.

DNI learns to predict that missing cotangent. A small synthesiser ``M`` maps the
window-exit hidden state to an estimate of ``dL_future/dh^exit``, the estimate is
injected ahead of the window's own reverse pass, and the sum over windows
telescopes to the exact gradient. See :class:`DNI` for the scope of that claim
and :func:`train_synthetic_gradient` for the recipe that fits ``M``.

class SyntheticGradient(brainstate.nn.Module):
    r"""A per-hidden-group linear synthesiser of the future cotangent.

    One affine map per hidden group, taking that group's concatenated hidden
    value ``(*varshape, num_state)`` to a cotangent of the same shape. Linear
    with a bias, as in the paper: the target is itself a gradient, so a linear
    predictor is a reasonable hypothesis class and keeps the auxiliary problem
    convex.

    The parameters are **not** ETP routed. They are ordinary
    :class:`brainstate.ParamState`\ s that never appear in a
    ``hidden_param_op_relation``, because the synthesiser is not part of the
    model's recurrence: it observes ``h^exit`` and predicts, it does not
    participate in producing ``h``. :class:`DNI` keeps them out of the compiled
    graph by construction -- it is handed the *values* functionally rather than
    closing over the states.

    The final layer is zero-initialised, so a freshly constructed synthesiser
    predicts exactly zero and the learner starts bit-identical to the plain
    truncated rule. That is a deliberate property: it makes "DNI is off" and "DNI
    is untrained" the same run, so B1's no-op criterion is checkable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    group_shapes : dict of int to tuple
        ``group index -> (*varshape, num_state)``, from the compiled graph.
    hidden_width : int, optional
        Unused; kept for signature stability.
    scale : float, optional
        Standard deviation of the input-layer draw. Default ``0.0`` -- see the
        zero-initialisation note above; a non-zero value makes the synthesiser
        live from the start, which the B1 negative control needs.
    seed : int, optional
        Seed for the draws.

class DNI(ParamDimVjpAlgorithm):
    r"""Decoupled Neural Interfaces: a learned estimate of the truncated future.

    The coordinate is :class:`~braintrace.D_RTRL`'s with
    ``learning_signal='bootstrapped'``, and unlike the other two P4 presets it is
    **multi-step**: the whole point is a window with an exit, and a one-step
    window has almost no truncated future to estimate.

    What DNI fixes, precisely. Index windows ``[a_k, b_k)`` with ``b_k = a_{k+1}``
    and let ``l_t`` be the loss of the step that writes ``h^{t+1}``. The injected
    estimate is

    .. math::

        g_k \;\approx\; \frac{\partial \sum_{t \ge b_k} l_t}{\partial h^{b_k}}

    -- strictly future, half-open, so the exit step's own loss lies *inside*
    window ``k`` and is not counted twice.

    It reaches the plain parameters, the inputs and the other states, where the
    sum over windows then telescopes to the exact gradient. It deliberately does
    **not** reach the ETP parameters or the boundary learning signal: their
    cross-window credit is already carried by the eligibility trace, and adding
    the estimate there would count the same path a second time. So DNI does not
    make the ETP gradients better or worse -- with a synthesiser attached they are
    bit-identical to the plain run -- it gives the *plain* parameters the credit
    the trace already gives the ETP ones.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The one-step model.
    synthesizer : SyntheticGradient, optional
        The estimator. May be attached later via :meth:`attach_synthesizer`; a
        window that runs without one raises rather than silently degrading to the
        truncated rule.
    name : str, optional
        Node name.
    vjp_method : str, optional
        Must be ``'multi-step'`` (the default).
    fast_solve : bool, optional
        Whether registered closed-form kernels may be used. Default ``True``.
    trace_dtype : DTypeLike, optional
        Reduced trace precision.
    chunked_trace : bool, optional
        Whether to roll the trace in chunks. Default ``True``.
    control_flow : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Control-flow canonicalization policy.
    snap_max_jacobian_elements : int, optional
        Passed through; unused at ``recurrence_scope='diagonal'``.

    Notes
    -----
    The synthesiser's parameter *values* are threaded into the traced computation
    as an explicit argument rather than closed over, so ``jax.custom_vjp`` never
    captures a tracer it might be asked to differentiate, and the estimate is
    wrapped in ``stop_gradient`` so the online loss cannot train the synthesiser
    through the wrong path. Fit it with :func:`train_synthetic_gradient`.

    The regression target for ``M(h^{a_k})`` is ``dL_{>= a_k}/dh^{a_k}``, and the
    learner already produces exactly that: with the hidden states in the
    differentiation set, ``brainstate.transform.grad`` returns the window's
    hidden cotangent, which (by the second pass of
    ``_update_fn_bwd``) already carries the future term. So no new side channel is
    needed -- the target comes out of the public API.

    Two properties make the fit honest, and both are enforced here:

    * The **model** parameters do not move -- only the synthesiser's are handed
      to the optimiser;
    * The **target is detached**, so the regression cannot reshape the model's
      gradients to make itself easy to predict.

    The auxiliary optimiser is left to the caller, as it is in the paper.

    Parameters
    ----------
    learner : DNI
        A compiled learner with a synthesiser attached.
    inputs : array
        A ``(T, ...)`` sequence, consumed one window at a time. ``T`` must be a
        multiple of *chunk_size*; a ragged final window is refused rather than
        truncated (see Raises).
    chunk_size : int, optional
        Steps per window. This **must match the window size the learner will be
        driven with**: the synthesiser predicts the future at a window boundary,
        and boundaries move when the window size does. Training on one-step
        windows and then deploying on longer ones fits the wrong target -- a
        much shorter future -- and the result can easily be worse than no
        synthesiser at all. Default ``1``.
    loss_fn : callable, optional
        ``loss_fn(output) -> scalar``. This **must be the objective the learner
        will actually be trained on**, and it is the second half of the same trap
        ``chunk_size`` documents. The synthesiser predicts
        ``dL_{>= b}/dh^b`` -- a derivative *of this loss*. Fit it against the
        default sum-of-squares and then descend on, say,
        ``((out - target) ** 2).mean()``, and the injected cotangent is the
        gradient of a different function at a different scale: not an
        approximation of the future credit but noise with the shape of one.
        Measured on the delayed-reward fixture, a mismatched ``loss_fn`` left the
        run *worse* than leaving DNI off entirely. Default: sum of squares.
    optimizer : braintools.optim.Optimizer, optional
        Already registered against ``learner.synthesizer.states_dict()``. If
        ``None``, a plain SGD step with learning rate ``lr`` is applied.
    lr : float, optional
        Learning rate for the built-in SGD step. Ignored when ``optimizer`` is
        given. Default ``1e-2``.
    epochs : int, optional
        Passes over ``inputs``.
    reset : bool, optional
        Whether to re-initialise the model states and the trace before each
        epoch. Default ``True``.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size for that re-initialisation. Inferred from the learner's own
        hidden states when omitted, which is almost always what you want; pass it
        only to override. It is *not* assumed to be 1 -- doing so either raises a
        shape error on a wider learner or, worse, succeeds and fits the
        synthesiser against the wrong initial states.

    Returns
    -------
    list of float
        The mean squared prediction error per epoch, averaged over every window
        boundary *and* the terminal boundary.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If no synthesiser is attached to *learner*.
    ValueError
        If *chunk_size* is below 1, or if it does not divide ``len(inputs)``.

    The window loop is a ``brainstate.transform.for_loop``, so the body -- which
    drives the learner through its ``custom_vjp`` and then takes a regression
    step -- is traced once per epoch rather than once per window (AGENTS.md
    rule 10). Everything that changes across windows is ``State`` and threads
    through automatically: the model's hidden states, the learner's trace, the
    synthesiser's parameters, and the optimiser's moments. Epochs remain a Python
    loop, because ``reset`` calls ``init_all_states``, which reallocates state and
    cannot run under a trace.

    Each epoch fits one extra pair beyond the window loop: the terminal state
    ``h^T`` against a target of exactly zero. Deployment injects at window *exit*
    states while the loop iterates *entry* states, and those sets differ at the
    ends -- ``h^T`` is injected at but never otherwise trained, and its true
    future gradient is zero because nothing follows it.
