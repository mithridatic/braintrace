"""P2 regression guard: the axis refactor must not move any preset's gradients.

The golden values in ``_testdata/p2_golden.npz`` were captured from commit
``156d058`` — the tree *before* the P2 axis decomposition — and are compared
against the live code here. See
``docs/specs/2026-07-25-p2-axis-decomposition.md`` § Test plan.

Three properties make this guard non-vacuous, and all are asserted rather than
assumed:

- **The oracle path can see a learning-rule axis.** Golden values are captured
  through :func:`chunked_online_param_gradients` with ``chunk_size < T``. The
  full-window multi-step path returns BPTT for every algorithm at every
  hyperparameter (F-23), so golden values taken there would be identical across
  all six cases and would guard nothing.
  ``test_axis_distinctness_is_as_measured`` pins that the captured cases really
  are distinguishable on this path.
- **The model is live.** ``test_models_are_live`` pins a non-trivial BPTT
  gradient, so no comparison is being made against zeros (F-25 / lesson 4).
- **Every trace path is covered.** The engines reach the trace three different
  ways, and a golden set that only exercised the defaults would leave two of
  them free to move. :data:`PATH_CASES` adds the missing two — see the table
  there.

Comparison is **per leaf**, not over a joint norm: the parameter trees here have
one leaf carrying ~30x the norm of the other, so a joint norm would let a
complete corruption of the small leaf pass under the threshold.
