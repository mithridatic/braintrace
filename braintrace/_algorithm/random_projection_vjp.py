    r"""Rank-1 random-projection eligibility trace — the UORO engine.

    Per hidden group ``g`` the influence of parameter ``j`` on hidden unit
    ``u = (position, state)`` is carried by **one rank-1 pair**

    .. math::

        \tilde\varepsilon_g[j, u] \approx \tilde s_g[u] \, \tilde\theta_g[j]

    with :math:`\tilde s_g` shaped ``(*varshape, num_state)`` and
    :math:`\tilde\theta_g` parameter-shaped — no hidden axis, no trailing state
    axis. One :math:`\tilde s` per group; one :math:`\tilde\theta` per
    ``(group, ParamState path)``, so a weight consumed by two relations of one
    group keeps a single parameter factor and the two projections are summed into
    it.

    With :math:`\nu_g` a Rademacher draw of :math:`\tilde s_g`'s shape and
    :math:`J_f` the instantaneous term, the step is

    .. math::

        \mathrm{proj}_g &= \nu_g^\top J_f \\
        \rho_0 &= \sqrt{(\|\tilde\theta_g\| + \epsilon) /
                        (\|D_g \tilde s_g\| + \epsilon)} \\
        \rho_1 &= \sqrt{(\|\mathrm{proj}_g\| + \epsilon) /
                        (\|\nu_g\| + \epsilon)} \\
        \tilde s_g &\leftarrow \rho_0 (D_g \tilde s_g) + \rho_1 \nu_g \\
        \tilde\theta_g &\leftarrow \tilde\theta_g / \rho_0 +
                                   \mathrm{proj}_g / \rho_1

    and the gradient contributed at a window boundary is
    :math:`\sum_g (\text{signal}_g \cdot \tilde s_g)\, \tilde\theta_g` — a scalar
    per group times a parameter-shaped array.

    **Unbiased for what.** Conditionally on earlier draws, the updated outer
    product is ``a b^T + c d^T + (rho0/rho1) a d^T + (rho1/rho0) c b^T`` with
    ``a = D s_tilde``, ``b = theta_tilde``, ``c = nu``, ``d = nu^T J_f``. The
    first term is ``D eps_tilde`` (``rho0`` cancels), the second is
    ``nu nu^T J_f``, and the two cross terms are **odd** in the current draw while
    ``rho1`` is even, so any negation-symmetric draw law with
    ``E[nu nu^T] == I`` gives ``E[eps_tilde_new] == D eps_tilde + J_f`` exactly.
    Induction over time then gives an unbiased estimate of **the exact
    within-group influence recursion that the compiled transition defines**.

    That is the whole claim, and it is narrower than "unbiased". Three
    approximations are untouched:

    1. **Cross-group coupling** — the compiler splits hidden states into groups
       and drops inter-group terms; one factor pair per group cannot carry them;
    2. **The instantaneous term's tail** — ``df`` comes from a single all-ones
       JVP of the ``y -> hidden`` map, exact only for a position-preserving
       elementwise tail (finding F-31);
    3. **Each primitive's own solve regime** — the projector is built from the
       framework's own per-primitive rules, so it inherits them exactly.

    On a single-group model with a position-preserving elementwise tail — the
    class where that recursion is itself exact — this is therefore unbiased for
    BPTT. Elsewhere it is unbiased for the block-local recursion and biased
    against BPTT, like every other coordinate in this repository. It is *not*
    restricted to that class.

    **Memory, honestly.** The carrier is ``|theta| + B * P * S`` elements against
    ``B * |theta| * S`` for the anchored per-parameter trace: on
    ``tanh_rnn(3, 4)`` that is 20 against 16. UORO is **not** a memory win over
    the anchored trace — it is a *bias* win at comparable carrier size, and a
    memory win against saturated SnAp-n (64) or the full influence matrix (64),
    which is what unbiasedness would otherwise cost. And ``O(|theta| + P S)``
    describes **carrier storage, not peak memory**: the full transition Jacobian
    is an ``O((P S)^2)`` transient per step (follow-up F-32 tracks a matrix-free
    ``D @ s`` product). The fused stepper keeps that transient per-step rather
    than stacked over the window.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The one-step model.
    name : str, optional
        Node name.
    vjp_method : str, optional
        ``'single-step'`` or ``'multi-step'``. Default ``'multi-step'``: the
        chunked finite-window path requires it, and it is the path the estimator
        is validated on.
    fast_solve : bool, optional
        Whether registered closed-form kernels may be used when building the
        projector. Default ``True``.
    control_flow : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Control-flow canonicalization policy.
    config : ETraceConfig, optional
        The learning-rule coordinate. Must have
        ``trace_factorization='random_projection'``.
    projection_key : int or jax.Array, optional
        Seed for the projection stream. Default ``42``. ``reset_state``
        re-derives the stream from it, so a reset run repeats bit-for-bit.
    projection_eps : float, optional
        Guard added to every norm before the ratio. Default ``1e-12``. At the
        first step both factors are zero, so both ratios are ``0/0``; with
        ``projection_eps=0`` the carrier is NaN at every window length. Because
        the guard perturbs the normalisers, the exactness pins carry a tolerance
        above float64 epsilon — see ``uoro_test.py``.
    random_feedback_key : jax.Array, optional
        Passed through to the base class for ``learning_signal='random_feedback'``.
    snap_max_jacobian_elements : int, optional
        Maximum number of elements in the materialized full hidden Jacobian.
