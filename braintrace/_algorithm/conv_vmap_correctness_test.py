"""Conv / mixed ETP under ``brainstate.nn.Vmap(vmap_states='new')`` correctness.

Regression coverage for the eligibility-trace path through the *batched* online
executor wrapped by ``brainstate.nn.Vmap`` (the ``OnlineVmapTrainer`` flow used
by ``examples/004``). This path was previously uncovered — conv was exercised
only at the rule level (``_op/conv_test.py``) and the "conv" model in
``transform_correctness_test`` is actually a matmul — which let two regressions
through:

1. *Pure conv.* A conv forward forces a leading batch axis on its input, but
   under ``vmap_states='new'`` the hidden-state traces are per-lane and carry no
   batch axis, so the instantaneous, recurrent and solve terms saw a singleton
   batch on the input but none on the cotangent.

2. *Mixed batched + unbatched.* When a conv (batched primitive) is composed with
   a ``Linear`` that, compiled per-lane, dispatches to the *unbatched* ``etp_mv``
   (1-D input), the solve's trailing batch-sum was gated on a global "any
   relation batched" flag and so collapsed the *unbatched* Linear gradient's
   leading in-feature axis too — the ``examples/004`` layer4 failure.

3. *Norm in the transition.* ``conv -> LayerNorm -> IF`` makes ``dh/dy``
   non-diagonal; the all-ones jvp returns its row sums, exactly zero for the
   shift-invariant norm. A ``use_fast_variance=True`` norm leaves a float32
   residual instead, which under ``vmap_states='new'`` the recurrent trace and
   ``rsqrt(var+eps)`` amplify into an overflow that diverges from the eager
   reference — the ``examples/004`` ``loss=ln(10)`` stall.

**Oracle (exact, transform-invariance).** ``brainstate.nn.Vmap`` is a transform;
for parameters shared across lanes its grad sums the per-lane gradients. So the
gradient from the ``vmap_new_states`` + ``Vmap`` path on a batch of ``B`` samples
must equal the sum over ``b`` of the *eager, batch=1* gradient on sample ``b``.
The eager batch=1 path is independently healthy for conv (states are initialised
*with* a size-1 batch, so input and trace batch axes agree), which makes it a
trustworthy reference regardless of D_RTRL's approximation quality.
