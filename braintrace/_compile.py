    This is the unified entry point. It initializes the model's states, builds
    the eligibility-trace graph, checks that the model is trainable online, and
    optionally prints a compilation report before returning a ready-to-``update``
    learner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The recurrent / spiking model defining one-step behavior. It does **not**
        need to be pre-initialized; ``compile`` always (re)initializes its states.
    algorithm : type, str or ETraceConfig
        An :class:`ETraceAlgorithm` subclass, a registered case-insensitive
        name, or an :class:`ETraceConfig` naming the learning-rule coordinate
        directly. Registered names are ``'d_rtrl'``, ``'pp_prop'``,
        ``'es_d_rtrl'``, ``'esd_rtrl'``, ``'eprop'``, ``'e_prop'``,
        ``'ostl_recurrent'``, ``'ostl_feedforward'``, ``'uoro'``,
        ``'three_factor'``, and ``'dni'``. The aliases ``'es_d_rtrl'`` and
        ``'esd_rtrl'`` select :class:`pp_prop`; ``'e_prop'`` selects
        :class:`EProp`. :class:`SnAp` has no registered string name and must be
        passed as a class. A config selects the engine through its
        ``trace_factorization`` and is forwarded to the constructor, so any
        coordinate admitted by the compatibility matrix can be compiled
        without a named preset.
    *example_inputs : Any
        Example call inputs (arrays / :class:`SingleStepData` /
        :class:`MultiStepData`) matching what ``learner.update(...)`` will
        receive. At least one is required.
    batch_size : int or None, optional
        Forwarded to ``brainstate.nn.init_all_states``. ``None`` (default)
        initializes unbatched states. Must match the batch dimension of
        ``example_inputs``.
    seed : int or None, optional
        If given, state initialization runs inside
        ``brainstate.random.seed_context`` for reproducibility; the global
        RNG is restored afterwards. ``None`` (default) leaves the RNG untouched.
        Weights created at model-construction time are outside this scope.
    verbose : int, optional
        Report verbosity printed at compile time: ``0`` (default) silent, ``1``
        the structural summary, ``2`` additionally compiler WARNING/ERROR
        diagnostics. Other values raise :class:`ValueError`.
    vmap : bool, optional
        When ``False`` (default) states are initialized with
        ``init_all_states(model, batch_size=batch_size)``. When ``True``, states
        are created under
        ``brainstate.transform.vmap_new_states(state_tag='new', axis_size=batch_size)``
        and the learner is wrapped in :class:`ETraceVmap`. In vmap mode:
        ``example_inputs`` carry the batch axis (axis 0); ``batch_size`` is
        **required** and used as the vmap ``axis_size``; the return value is a
        :class:`ETraceVmap` whose ``.module`` is the unbatched learner (use
        ``result.module.report`` for its report). Drive sequences through the
        returned wrapper, never through ``result.module``. Requires a model
        whose hidden states are all (re)created in ``init_all_states``; models
        holding construction-time states may raise
        ``brainstate.transform.BatchAxisError``.
    **options : Any
        Forwarded to the algorithm constructor. See *Algorithm options* below.

    Returns
    -------
    ETraceAlgorithm or ETraceVmap
        When ``vmap=False``, the compiled learner carries a
        :attr:`~ETraceAlgorithm.report`; call ``.update(*inputs)`` to train.
        When ``vmap=True``, returns an :class:`ETraceVmap` wrapper (also a
        ``brainstate.nn.Vmap``); access the underlying learner's report as
        ``.module.report``. Call ``etrace_grad`` and ``etrace_evolve`` on the
        wrapper itself, not on ``.module``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``algorithm`` is an unknown name, no ``example_inputs`` are given,
        ``verbose`` is not in ``{0, 1, 2}``, or ``vmap=True`` without
        ``batch_size``.
    TypeError
        If ``algorithm`` is not an ``ETraceAlgorithm`` subclass, registered
        string, or :class:`ETraceConfig`; if a required algorithm option is
        missing; or if the same config is supplied both as ``algorithm`` and
        through ``config=``.
    braintrace.CompilationError
        If no trainable weights are routed through ETP ops (nothing to learn
        online).

    Notes
    -----
    **Algorithm options.** ``**options`` are forwarded verbatim to the algorithm
    constructor. Required options have no default; omitting one raises
    ``TypeError``. The class pages are the authoritative source for accepted
    options:

    - :class:`D_RTRL` for ``'d_rtrl'``.
    - :class:`pp_prop` for ``'pp_prop'``, ``'es_d_rtrl'``, and ``'esd_rtrl'``.
    - :class:`EProp` for ``'eprop'`` and ``'e_prop'``.
    - :class:`OSTLRecurrent` for ``'ostl_recurrent'``.
    - :class:`OSTLFeedforward` for ``'ostl_feedforward'``.
    - :class:`UORO` for ``'uoro'``.
    - :class:`ThreeFactor` for ``'three_factor'``.
    - :class:`DNI` for ``'dni'``.
    - :class:`SnAp` for class-only SnAp compilation.

    Passing an algorithm class supports subclasses and avoids the string
    registry. Passing :class:`ETraceConfig` selects
    :class:`ParamDimVjpAlgorithm`, :class:`IODimVjpAlgorithm`, or
    :class:`RandomProjectionVjpAlgorithm` from ``trace_factorization``. Do not
    also pass ``config=`` in that case.

    Calling ``compile`` twice on the same model re-initializes its states.

    **Axis coordinates.** Passing an :class:`ETraceConfig` in the ``algorithm``
    position compiles a coordinate that may have no preset name:

    .. code-block:: python

        # an x-side leak with an instantaneous f-side
        learner = braintrace.compile(
            model,
