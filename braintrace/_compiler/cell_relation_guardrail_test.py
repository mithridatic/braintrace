"""L2 compiler regression baseline (spec section 5.4): the relation enumeration
for every public RNN cell is pinned to a known profile — the number of
hidden->param->op relations, the set of included trainable weights, and the set
of weights excluded by the no-W->W->h invariant. A meta-test ties this matrix to
the cell registry so a newly added cell must add a guardrail row.

Ground truth verified by compiling each cell (cls(3, 4), unbatched input) on
2026-05-27. Sections 5.1-5.3 are covered elsewhere (compiler_oracle_test.py,
compiler_property_test.py, graph_test.py) and are not duplicated here.
