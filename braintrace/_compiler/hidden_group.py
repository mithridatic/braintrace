        Notes
        -----
        For diagonal recurrence (:attr:`is_diagonal_recurrence` is ``True``) the
        positions are independent, so the cheap column-sum produced by
        ``jacrev_last_dim`` already equals this block diagonal. For coupled
        recurrence the column sum would instead add in the off-diagonal
        cross-position terms -- inflating every entry and driving the eligibility
        trace to overflow -- so the true block diagonal is extracted directly via
        ``block_diagonal_last_dim``.

        When the transition contains a ``while`` equation (an opaque forward
        node), reverse-mode differentiation is unavailable (JAX has no
        transpose rule for ``while``), so the Jacobian is extracted in
        forward mode instead (``jacfwd_last_dim``, or
        ``block_diagonal_last_dim`` with ``use_forward_mode=True``) --
        same values, different derivative mode.

        reach here.

        The Jacobian is only *full* if the recurrent ETP mixing was traced into
        the transition, i.e. under ``include_recurrent_mixing``. Rule 11

        The length check is not decorative. Before it existed this method zipped

        surfaced later as a shape mismatch in unrelated trace math -- or not at
        all, when the widths happened to coincide. It is an ``if ... raise`` and
        not an ``assert`` so that ``python -O`` cannot strip it.

        The check reads only Python-level lengths, never array data, so it costs

        The width check is the inverse of :meth:`concat_hidden`'s length check
        and closes the same silent path. ``u.math.split`` at this group's
        cumulative boundaries returns one part per hidden state plus a trailing
        remainder, and that remainder is dropped by the ``zip`` below -- so a
        *too wide* slab silently loses its surplus, and a *too narrow* one
        silently yields empty parts. Like the sibling check this is an
        ``if ... raise`` rather than an ``assert`` so ``python -O`` cannot strip
        it, and it reads only the static shape.

    The trace slot ``(p, (k, a))`` holds
    :math:`\partial h[\mathrm{nbr}[p,k], a] / \partial \theta_p`, and the
    instantaneous term of a relation anchored at position ``p`` lands on ``p``

    Parameters
    ----------
    jaxpr : Jaxpr
        The jaxpr for the model.
    hidden_outvar_to_invar : dict
        Mapping from hidden output variable to hidden input variable.
    weight_invars : set
        Set of weight input variables.
    invar_to_hidden_path : dict
        Mapping from weight input variable to hidden state path.
    outvar_to_hidden_path : dict
        Mapping from hidden output variable to hidden state path.
    path_to_state : dict
        Mapping from hidden state path to state.
    include_recurrent_mixing : bool, optional
        Whether to trace recurrent ETP *mixing* primitives
        (``etp_mv``/``etp_mm``/``etp_conv``) into the hidden-to-hidden
        transition jaxpr.

        - ``False`` (default, "without recurrence"): these primitives are
          treated as boundaries and excluded, so the transition keeps only
          element-wise (and non-ETP) state-to-state paths. The recurrent
          weight's temporal credit is carried by its eligibility trace. This
          keeps the recurrent Jacobian ``D^t`` contractive and the trace
          bounded (the standard D-RTRL / e-prop diagonal approximation).
        - ``True`` ("with recurrence"): the mixing primitives are traced into
          the transition, so ``D^t`` carries the full per-step recurrent
          coupling. The resulting (coupled) Jacobian is extracted per
          position via :func:`block_diagonal_last_dim` (selected automatically
          by :attr:`HiddenGroup.is_diagonal_recurrence`).
    sparse_n : int or None, optional
        SnAp order for ``recurrence_scope='sparse_n'``; ``None`` (default)
        leaves every group's ``snap`` pattern unset.
    snap_max_jacobian_elements : int, optional
        Ceiling on each hidden group's widened block Jacobian,
        ``P * (K * S) ** 2`` elements. Configurations exceeding it are
        refused with :class:`~braintrace.NotSupportedError`.
    control_flow : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        The :class:`~braintrace.ControlFlowPolicy` governing how opaque
        control-flow equations touching hidden states are handled
        (``'opaque-fwd'`` keeps a weight-free while/scan/cond as an opaque
        forward node; ``'error'`` raises as before Phase 3).
    descended_scan_eqn_ids : frozenset of int, optional
        ``id()`` values of scan equations rewritten by structured scan descent
        (Phase 4); skipped by this walker.
    descended_hidden_paths : frozenset of Path, optional
        Hidden-state paths covered by descended scan bodies; excluded from the
