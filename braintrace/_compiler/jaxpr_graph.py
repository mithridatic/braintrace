"""Shared jaxpr-graph utilities for the ETrace compiler.

Every compiler pass needs the same handful of graph primitives over a
``Jaxpr``: a producer map (var -> defining equation), a consumer map
(var -> reading equations), ordered forward reachability, and — since the
analyses cannot see through ``jit`` call boundaries — a pass that splices
``jit``/``pjit`` bodies into the surrounding jaxpr. They live here so the
passes in :mod:`hid_param_op`, :mod:`hidden_group`, and
:mod:`hidden_pertubation` share one implementation.

All traversals use insertion-ordered ``dict`` objects as ordered sets, so
results are deterministic across processes (plain ``set`` iteration follows
memory-address hashes for jaxpr ``Var`` objects).

    The ETrace analyses identify weights, hidden states, and ETP primitives by
    ``Var`` identity in one flat jaxpr; a ``jit`` call boundary hides its body
    behind fresh inner variables, so weights or hidden states used inside a
    user's ``jax.jit``-wrapped function were previously either rejected or
    silently excluded. Inlining removes the boundary before any analysis runs.

    The pass is recursive (``jit`` inside ``jit`` is flattened), lifts inner
    closure constants into the outer ``constvars``/``consts``, and rewires
    pass-through outputs by substitution. Every spliced body has its internal
    variables freshened *per call site*: JAX's trace cache hands every call
    of the same jitted function the same inner jaxpr object, so splicing it
    verbatim more than once would define its variables twice and silently
    alias the calls' results. Top-level equations that are not jit calls keep
    their original ``Var`` objects. Control-flow bodies
    (``scan``/``while``/``cond``) are descended: a body containing a jit call
    is rewritten with that call inlined (the eqn is rebuilt with new body
    params), while eqns whose bodies are jit-free are kept unchanged **by
    identity** — later passes key exemption sets on eqn identity.
    Custom-derivative call primitives are left untouched:
    ``custom_jvp_call``/``custom_vjp_call`` carry derivative semantics that
    must not be flattened away.

    Parameters
    ----------
    closed_jaxpr : ClosedJaxpr
        The closed jaxpr to inline.

    Returns
    -------
    ClosedJaxpr
        A new closed jaxpr with no top-level ``jit`` equations, evaluating to
