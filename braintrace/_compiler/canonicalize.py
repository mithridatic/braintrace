"""Jaxpr canonicalization passes for the ETrace compiler.

Control-flow constructs hide their bodies behind sub-jaxprs, but every ETrace
analysis identifies weights, hidden states, and ETP primitives by ``Var``
identity in one flat top-level jaxpr. The passes in this module rewrite
ETP-relevant control flow into flat, semantically identical equation
sequences before any analysis runs — the same role
:func:`~braintrace._compiler.jaxpr_graph.inline_jit_calls` plays for ``jit``
boundaries.

Phase 1 implements ``cond`` if-conversion (:func:`if_convert_conds`):
Every ETP-relevant ``cond`` equation is replaced by the inlined bodies of
*all* its branches followed by one ``select_n`` equation per output. The
integer index semantics of ``cond`` and ``select_n`` match exactly, and the
JVP of ``select_n`` selects tangents, so — for branches with finite values
and Jacobians — the canonicalized jaxpr is exact in both value and
derivative (see :class:`ControlFlowPolicy` for the dead-branch NaN/Inf
caveat under reverse mode).

Phase 2 implements inner-``scan`` unrolling (:func:`unroll_inner_scans`):
Every ETP-relevant ``scan`` equation with static length at most
``policy.scan_unroll_limit`` is replaced by ``length`` clones of its body
(fresh variables per iteration, carry threaded between them), with per-
iteration ``xs`` slices materialized as ``slice``/``squeeze`` equations and
consumed stacked ``ys`` rebuilt with ``broadcast_in_dim``/``concatenate``.
Unrolling is semantically identical — values and all derivatives are exact.

:func:`canonicalize_control_flow` runs both passes to a joint fixpoint, so
a ``cond`` inside a ``scan`` body (and vice versa) canonicalizes fully.
Every fixpoint loop here is capped at ``policy.fixpoint_iteration_limit``
sweeps: control flow that keeps regenerating faster than the sweeps consume
it raises a :class:`~braintrace.CompilationError` naming the offending
equations rather than spinning forever.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ControlFlowPolicy:
    """Policy knobs governing control-flow canonicalization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cond : str, optional
        How ETP-relevant ``cond`` equations are handled. ``'convert'``
        (default) if-converts them into inlined branches + ``select_n``;
        ``'opaque'`` leaves every ``cond`` untouched, so the existing
        control-flow restrictions apply (weights used inside raise
        ``NotImplementedError``; ETP primitives inside are excluded with a
        warning).
    scan_unroll_limit : int, optional
        Maximum static length of an ETP-relevant inner ``scan`` that
        ``unroll_inner_scans`` unrolls into flat equations. Longer (or
        effectful, or ``while``-containing) scans stay opaque with a
        ``DiagnosticKind.SCAN_UNROLL_SKIPPED`` warning, and
        the existing control-flow restrictions apply. ``0`` (or negative)
        disables unrolling entirely. Default ``16``.
    while_hidden : str, optional
        How an *opaque* control-flow equation (``while``, or a ``scan``/
        ``cond`` the canonicalizer left opaque) that produces a hidden-state
        output **without consuming any weight invar** is handled.
        ``'opaque-fwd'`` (default) keeps it as an opaque forward node: the
        whole equation is embedded in the hidden-to-hidden transition and
        its Jacobian is extracted in forward mode (``while`` has no
        reverse-mode rule), recorded as a
        ``DiagnosticKind.CONTROL_FLOW_OPAQUE_FWD`` INFO
        diagnostic. ``'error'`` restores the pre-opaque-forward behaviour of
        raising ``NotImplementedError``.
    etp_in_control_flow : str, optional
        How an ETP primitive found *inside* a remaining opaque control-flow
        body is handled during relation discovery. ``'error'`` (default)
        raises ``NotImplementedError`` — that weight would otherwise
        silently drop out of online learning. ``'exclude'`` restores the
        previous behaviour of a loud warning
        (``DiagnosticKind.PRIMITIVE_INSIDE_CONTROL_FLOW``)
        plus exclusion of the weight from ETP relations.
    scan_descent : str, optional
        How ETP-relevant scans too long to unroll are handled. ``'auto'``
        (default) rewrites the scan for structured descent: relations and
        hidden groups are discovered inside the body and the eligibility
        trace is folded over the substep axis (see
        ``braintrace._compiler.scan_descent``). ``'off'`` preserves the
        pre-Phase-4 behavior: the scan stays opaque and compilation fails
        on the existing control-flow restrictions.
    fixpoint_iteration_limit : int, optional
        Maximum number of sweeps a canonicalization fixpoint may run before
        giving up with a :class:`~braintrace.CompilationError` naming the
        equations the last sweep was still rewriting. Default ``64``.

        This bounds *loop iterations*, not the size of any single rewrite —
        the per-rewrite bound is ``scan_unroll_limit``. Each sweep rewrites
        the currently visible ``cond``/``scan`` equations and re-inlines the
        ``jit`` bodies they surface, so the number of sweeps a jaxpr needs
        is set by how deeply its ETP-relevant control flow nests, plus one
        final sweep that rewrites nothing and so proves the fixpoint was
        reached. Real models nest a handful of levels deep; raise the limit
        if yours genuinely nests deeper. There is deliberately no
        "unbounded" setting: without a cap, a jaxpr that regenerates
        convertible control flow as fast as the sweeps consume it hangs the
        compiler with no diagnostic at all. Must be a positive integer.

    Notes
    -----
    If-conversion changes execution semantics: **both** branches of a
    converted ``cond`` execute every step, and ``select_n`` discards the
    dead branch's *value*. Guarded partial operations (a ``cond`` used to
    avoid ``sqrt`` of a negative number, for example) therefore need care:

    - **Values and forward-mode (JVP) derivatives are safe** — ``select_n``
      selects whole outputs and tangents, so a dead-branch NaN/Inf never
      reaches the selected result.
    - **Reverse-mode (VJP) gradients are NOT safe** when the dead branch's
      local Jacobian is NaN/Inf: ``select_n``'s transpose hands the dead
      branch an exact-zero cotangent, but the dead branch's VJP multiplies
      that zero by its NaN/Inf Jacobian (``0 * nan = nan``), contaminating
      gradients of inputs shared with the live branch — the classic
      single-``where`` pitfall. If a ``cond`` guards a partial operation's
      domain, keep it opaque (``cond='opaque'``) or guard the operand
      itself (e.g. ``sqrt(where(ok, x, 1.))``) inside the branch.

    For branches whose values and Jacobians are finite, the canonicalized
    jaxpr is exact in both value and derivative. Branches with effects,
    containing ``while``, or containing a ``scan`` that
    ``unroll_inner_scans`` could not unroll, are never converted (see
    ``if_convert_conds``). Scan unrolling itself has no semantics
    change: the unrolled equations compute exactly what the loop computed.

    -------

    materialized as ``slice`` + ``squeeze`` equations, and — for stacked

    jaxpr's ``invars``/``outvars`` are preserved by object identity, so every
    Var-identity lookup table built from them stays valid. Unrolling is
    semantically identical: values and all derivatives are exact.

    Parameters
    ----------
    closed_jaxpr : ClosedJaxpr
        The closed jaxpr to canonicalize. ``jit`` equations should already be
        inlined (the pass re-runs
        :func:`~braintrace._compiler.jaxpr_graph.inline_jit_calls` after each
        sweep to flatten ``jit`` bodies surfaced from unrolled scan bodies).
    weight_invars : Container[Var]
        Jaxpr input variables of the trainable weights.
    hidden_invars : Container[Var]
        Jaxpr input variables of the hidden states.
    hidden_outvars : Container[Var]
        Jaxpr output variables of the hidden states.
    policy : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Canonicalization policy. With ``policy.scan_unroll_limit <= 0`` the
        input is returned unchanged.

    Returns
    -------
    ClosedJaxpr
        The canonicalized closed jaxpr. When nothing is unrolled, the input
        object itself is returned unchanged.

    Raises
    ------
    braintrace.CompilationError
        If the unrolling fixpoint has not converged after
        ``policy.fixpoint_iteration_limit`` sweeps. The message names the
        ``scan`` equations the last sweep was still rewriting.

    Notes
    -----
    A ``scan`` equation is unrolled only when it is *relevant* — its body
    transitively contains an ETP primitive, or the equation consumes a
    weight/hidden input variable, or produces a hidden output variable — and
    *eligible*: static ``length`` in ``[1, policy.scan_unroll_limit]``, no
    effects, no inner ``while``, and no scanned-over (``xs``) operand that is
    (or is computed from) a trainable weight. A relevant scan whose ``xs``
    carry a weight stays opaque with a
    :attr:`~braintrace.DiagnosticKind.RELATION_EXCLUDED_SLICED_WEIGHT`
    warning — after unrolling, each iteration would consume a *slice* of the
    stacked parameter, which the relation pass would mis-attribute to the
    full parameter (slice-aware relations are future work). Any other
    ineligible-but-relevant scan warns
    :attr:`~braintrace.DiagnosticKind.SCAN_UNROLL_SKIPPED`. In both cases
    the existing control-flow restrictions then apply unchanged. Irrelevant
    scans always stay opaque, at zero cost — in particular the outer
    time-step loop of a training harness is never touched.

    Alternates :func:`if_convert_conds`'s conversion sweep and
    :func:`unroll_inner_scans`'s unrolling sweep (re-inlining surfaced
    ``jit`` bodies after each) until neither changes the jaxpr. The joint

    surfaces once the scan unrolls and is then converted; an eligible
    ``scan`` inside a ``cond`` branch surfaces once the branch inlines and

    Parameters
    ----------
    closed_jaxpr : ClosedJaxpr
        The closed jaxpr to canonicalize, with ``jit`` equations already
        inlined.
    weight_invars : Container[Var]
        Jaxpr input variables of the trainable weights.
    hidden_invars : Container[Var]
        Jaxpr input variables of the hidden states.
    hidden_outvars : Container[Var]
        Jaxpr output variables of the hidden states.
    policy : ControlFlowPolicy, optional
        Canonicalization policy; each pass honors its own knob
        (``policy.cond``, ``policy.scan_unroll_limit``).

    Returns
    -------
    ClosedJaxpr
        The canonicalized closed jaxpr. When nothing changes, the input
        object itself is returned unchanged.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``policy.cond`` is neither ``'convert'`` nor ``'opaque'``.
    braintrace.CompilationError
        If the joint fixpoint has not converged after
