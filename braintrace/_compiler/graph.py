    and the eligibility-trace operations (ETP primitives). These relationships
    are later used to compute the weight spatial gradients, the hidden-state
    Jacobian, and the hidden-state-to-weight Jacobian.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : brainstate.nn.Module
        The model for which the eligibility-trace graph is built.
    *model_args : tuple
        The positional arguments required by the model.
    include_hidden_perturb : bool, optional
        Whether to include hidden perturbations in the graph. Default ``True``.
    include_recurrent_mixing : bool, optional
        Hidden-group grouping mode for the hidden-to-hidden transition. When
        ``False`` (default, "without recurrence"), recurrent ETP mixing
        primitives (e.g. the recurrent ``etp_mv``/``etp_mm``) are treated as
        boundaries and excluded from the transition jaxpr, so the transition is
        element-wise and the per-position recurrent Jacobian is diagonal (the
        bounded D-RTRL / e-prop approximation). When ``True`` ("with
        recurrence"), those primitives are traced into the transition, the
        recurrence becomes coupled, and the true per-position block-diagonal
        Jacobian is extracted (RTRL-exact temporal credit, e.g. for
        :class:`~braintrace.OSTLRecurrent`).
    sparse_n : int, optional
        SnAp order for ``recurrence_scope='sparse_n'``. When given, every hidden
        group carries the ``n``-step position neighbourhood derived from its own
        transition (implemented by the internal ``position_graph`` module) in
        ``HiddenGroup.snap``, and its trace's trailing state axis widens to
        ``K * num_state``. Requires ``include_recurrent_mixing=True`` -- the
        widened operator is gathered out of the coupled transition's Jacobian --
        and raises rather than degrading to ``K = 1`` if it is not set.
        ``None`` (default) for every other scope.
    snap_max_jacobian_elements : int, optional
        Ceiling on each group's widened block Jacobian, ``P * (K * S) ** 2``
        elements. Only consulted when *sparse_n* is given. Default
        ``DEFAULT_MAX_JACOBIAN_ELEMENTS``.
    control_flow : ControlFlowPolicy or None, optional
        Policy governing control-flow canonicalization and downstream
        handling, forwarded to :func:`~braintrace.extract_module_info` and
        (via ``ModuleInfo.control_flow``) to every later compiler pass.
        ``None`` (default) uses the default policy, which:

        - If-converts every ETP-relevant ``cond`` into inlined branches +
          ``select_n`` (both branches then execute every step); pass
          ``ControlFlowPolicy(cond='opaque')`` to restore the previous
          behavior (weights inside ``cond`` raise ``NotImplementedError``);
        - Unrolls every ETP-relevant ``scan`` of static length at most
          ``scan_unroll_limit`` (default 16);
        - Applies **structured scan descent** (``scan_descent='auto'``) to
          ETP-relevant scans *above* the unroll limit: relations and hidden
          groups are discovered inside the scan body, the equation is
          rewritten to emit stacked per-substep values as extra ys, and the
          eligibility trace is folded over the substep axis at runtime —
          compile size stays independent of the scan length. Pass
          ``ControlFlowPolicy(scan_descent='off')`` to restore the
          pre-Phase-4 error. See the internal ``scan_descent`` module;
        - Keeps a **weight-free** ``while`` that reads/updates hidden state
          as an opaque forward node (``while_hidden='opaque-fwd'``):
          Hidden-to-hidden Jacobians for groups whose transition crosses the
          loop are extracted in forward mode, and the perturbation pass
          detaches the loop's inputs with ``stop_gradient`` so the perturbed
          jaxpr stays reverse-traceable. Pass
          ``ControlFlowPolicy(while_hidden='error')`` to reject such loops
          instead. A weight *used through an ETP primitive* inside a
          ``while`` is always a hard error;
        - Raises on ETP primitives left inside a control-flow body the
          canonicalizer could not flatten
          (``etp_in_control_flow='error'``); pass
          ``ControlFlowPolicy(etp_in_control_flow='exclude')`` to restore
          the warn-and-exclude behavior;
        - Caps every canonicalization fixpoint at
          ``fixpoint_iteration_limit`` sweeps (default 64) so control flow
          that never converges raises
          :class:`~braintrace.CompilationError` naming the offending
          equations instead of hanging the compiler. Raise it for models
          that genuinely nest control flow deeper than that.
