def _reject_unsupported_options(

    """Raise if any option outside the ETP ``embedding`` primitive is enabled.

    ``max_norm`` and ``freeze`` wrap the lookup in ``stop_gradient``;
    ``scale_grad_by_freq`` and ``padding_idx`` live in the ``brainstate``
    parent's ``custom_vjp`` backward rule, which the ETP ``embedding``
    primitive replaces outright. None of the four is visible to the
    online-learning trace machinery, so honouring them silently would diverge
    from the ``brainstate`` semantics rather than reproduce them.

    Shared by :meth:`Embedding.__init__` and :meth:`Embedding.update` so that
    the unsupported set and its message cannot drift apart. The constructor is
    the gate that matters; ``update`` re-checks because these are plain public
    attributes a caller can still assign after construction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_norm : float or None
        The ``max_norm`` option. Unsupported unless ``None``.
    freeze : bool
        The ``freeze`` option. Unsupported unless ``False``.
    scale_grad_by_freq : bool
        The ``scale_grad_by_freq`` option. Unsupported unless ``False``.
    padding_idx : int or None
        The ``padding_idx`` option. Unsupported unless ``None``.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any argument is set to a value other than its default. The message
        names every offending option and its value, in the fixed order
        ``max_norm``, ``freeze``, ``scale_grad_by_freq``, ``padding_idx``.

class Embedding(brainstate.nn.Embedding):
    r"""A lookup table whose gather is routed through the ETP ``embedding`` op.

    Drop-in replacement for :class:`brainstate.nn.Embedding` that performs the
    table lookup with :func:`braintrace.embedding`, which is what makes the
    table eligible for online-learning trace computation. Indices of any rank
    are accepted; rank 2 and above are folded into one flat axis before the op
    (the rank-guarded primitive takes only scalar or ``(batch,)`` indices) and
    the output is unfolded back to ``(*indices.shape, *embedding_size)``.

    Four of the parent's options are **accepted for signature compatibility but
    not supported, and are rejected by the constructor**: ``max_norm``,
    ``freeze``, ``scale_grad_by_freq`` and ``padding_idx``. Each modifies the
    lookup or its gradient outside the ETP primitive that online learning
    traces, so there is no way to honour them without diverging from the
    ``brainstate`` semantics. They are part of the signature so that code
    written against :class:`brainstate.nn.Embedding` fails with a clear message
    at the constructor call rather than with a ``TypeError`` about an unexpected
    keyword — or, as before this validation moved, with a deferred failure at
    the first forward pass, which under ``jit`` can be far from the mistake.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_embeddings : int
        Size of the embedding dictionary. Must be non-negative.
    embedding_size : int or sequence of int
        Size of each embedding vector.
    embedding_init : Callable or ArrayLike, optional
        Initializer for the lookup table, of shape
        ``(num_embeddings, *embedding_size)``. Default is ``LecunUniform()``.
    padding_idx : int, optional
        Accepted but **not supported**; anything other than ``None`` raises
        ``NotImplementedError`` from the constructor. Zeroing the gradient of
        one row happens in the parent's backward rule, which the ETP primitive
        replaces.
    max_norm : float, optional
        Accepted but **not supported**; anything other than ``None`` raises
        ``NotImplementedError`` from the constructor. Renormalizing rows
        inserts a ``stop_gradient`` the trace machinery cannot see through.
    norm_type : float, optional
        The p of the p-norm used by ``max_norm``. Supported in the sense that
        it is accepted and stored, but inert: it only has an effect together
        with ``max_norm``, which is rejected. Default is ``2.0``.
    scale_grad_by_freq : bool, optional
        Accepted but **not supported**; ``True`` raises
        ``NotImplementedError`` from the constructor. The inverse-frequency
        scaling lives in the parent's backward rule, which the ETP primitive
        replaces. Default is ``False``.
    freeze : bool, optional
        Accepted but **not supported**; ``True`` raises
        ``NotImplementedError`` from the constructor. Freezing wraps the table
        in ``stop_gradient``, which removes the very gradient path online
        learning traces. Default is ``False``.
    name : str, optional
        Name of the module.
    param_type : type, optional
        Parameter state type. Default is ``brainstate.ParamState``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weight : brainstate.ParamState
        The learnable table, of shape ``(num_embeddings, *embedding_size)``.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        From the constructor, if ``max_norm``, ``freeze``,
        ``scale_grad_by_freq`` or ``padding_idx`` is set to a non-default
        value. The message names every offending option.

    See Also
    --------
    braintrace.embedding : The ETP primitive this layer wraps.
    brainstate.nn.Embedding : The upstream layer, which supports all options.

    Examples
    --------
    Look up rows of the table:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
        >>> import braintrace
        >>> layer = braintrace.nn.Embedding(10, 4)
        >>> layer(jnp.array([0, 3, 3])).shape
        (3, 4)

    Index arrays of rank 2 or higher are folded and unfolded automatically:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
        >>> import braintrace
        >>> layer = braintrace.nn.Embedding(10, 4)
        >>> layer(jnp.array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]])).shape
        (2, 3, 4)

    An unsupported option fails at the constructor, not at the forward pass:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import braintrace
        >>> braintrace.nn.Embedding(10, 4, freeze=True)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
