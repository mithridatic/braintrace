"""Tests for the ``braintrace.nn`` package root (``braintrace/nn/__init__.py``).

The module is a deprecation dispatcher: 8 names forward to :mod:`brainpy.state`
and 40 to :mod:`brainstate.nn`, each with a :class:`DeprecationWarning` naming
the replacement, and anything else raises :class:`AttributeError`.

That final ``raise`` is the contract this file exists for. A module-level
``__getattr__`` that falls off the end returns ``None``, so without it
``braintrace.nn.Typo`` would silently *be* ``None`` and blow up much later,
somewhere unrelated. ``braintrace/__init___test.py`` covers ``__dir__`` and two
sample forwards from the package-root side; the dispatcher's own contract --
every forwarded name, the warning text, the non-memoisation, and the
fallthrough -- is pinned here.

Spec: ``docs/specs/2026-08-07-e06-colocated-tests.md``.
