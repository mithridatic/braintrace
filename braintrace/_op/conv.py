r"""Convolution ETP primitive (``etp_conv_p``).

Always expects a batch dimension on the input. The full keyword surface
of ``jax.lax.conv_general_dilated`` is preserved; the wrapper splits and
recombines brainunit quantities for the input and kernel.

**Forward operation**

.. math::

    y_{b, \mathbf{s}, k}
      = \sum_{\mathbf{u}, c} x_{b, \mathbf{s}+\mathbf{u}, c}\,
                              K_{\mathbf{u}, c, k}
        \;+\; b_k

where :math:`\mathbf{s}` runs over spatial output positions,
:math:`\mathbf{u}` over the kernel spatial window, :math:`c` is the input
channel, :math:`k` the output channel, and the kernel layout follows the
``dimension_numbers`` supplied at bind-time. Because the bias is a single
value per output channel shared across every spatial position, its
Jacobian is fundamentally different from the kernel's.

**Role of each ETP rule**

Let :math:`\mathbf{D}_f^t = \partial h / \partial y` (one cotangent per
output element). The conv primitive implements:

* ``xy_to_dw`` — **param-shaped** instantaneous Jacobian, consumed by the
  IO-dim (ES-D-RTRL) algorithm at solve time. For the *kernel*, uses the
  conv VJP to produce the full weight Jacobian
  :math:`\partial h / \partial K` (requires :math:`x`). For the *bias*,
  stores the per-position cotangent
  :math:`\partial h / \partial b_k = (\partial h / \partial y)_{b,\mathbf{s},k}`
  **without** summing over spatial positions (the sum happens at the
  consumer's contraction step).

* ``instant_drtrl`` / ``dt_to_t`` / ``solve_drtrl`` — the param-dim
  D-RTRL trace machinery. Because the kernel is *spatially shared*
  (every output position reads the same :math:`K`) while the D-RTRL
  discount :math:`\mathbf{D}^t` acts per output element, no kernel-shaped
  (spatially pre-summed) trace can be exact: it multiplies a sum by a sum
  where a sum of products is required. The exact trace keeps the spatial
  output axes — for a diagonal hidden state :math:`h_{b,\mathbf{s},k}`,

  .. math::

      \epsilon^t_{b,\mathbf{s},\mathbf{u},c,k}
        = D^t_{b,\mathbf{s},k}\, \epsilon^{t-1}_{b,\mathbf{s},\mathbf{u},c,k}
          + (\mathbf{D}_f^t)_{b,\mathbf{s},k}\,
            \mathrm{patch}^t_{b,\mathbf{s},\mathbf{u},c},

  where :math:`\mathrm{patch}^t` is the receptive-field window of
  :math:`x^t` extracted by :func:`_conv_extract_patches`.

  - ``instant_drtrl`` adds the per-position term
    :math:`(\mathbf{D}_f^t)_{b,\mathbf{s},k}\,\mathrm{patch}^t_{b,\mathbf{s},\mathbf{u},c}`
    for the kernel, and the per-position cotangent (with the ``bias_fn``
    chain) for the bias.
  - ``dt_to_t`` (recurrence only) multiplies every trace slot by the
    per-position factor :math:`D^t_{b,\mathbf{s},k}` — no spatial sums
    anywhere.
  - ``solve_drtrl`` contracts the learning signal with the trace,
    performing the deferred spatial sum:
    :math:`\nabla K_{\mathbf{u},c,k} = \sum_{\mathbf{s}}
    g_{\mathbf{s},k}\, \epsilon_{\mathbf{s},\mathbf{u},c,k}` and
    :math:`\nabla b_k = \sum_{\mathbf{s}} g_{\mathbf{s},k}\,
    \epsilon_{b,\mathbf{s},k}`.

* ``init_drtrl`` — allocates the per-position kernel trace
  :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_K` of shape
  ``(batch, *spatial_out, *kernel_shape, n_state)`` plus the per-position
  :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_b` with output shape. This costs
  :math:`O(B\, S\, |K|)` memory (``S`` = spatial output size) — the price
  of exactness for a spatially shared kernel; for large convolutions
  prefer the IO-dim algorithm (``pp_prop`` / ``IODimVjpAlgorithm``).
  Grouped convolutions (``feature_group_count`` / ``batch_group_count``
  != 1) are rejected with ``NotImplementedError``.

* ``init_pp`` — allocates the pp-prop output-shaped df trace; the
  :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_x` factor in ES-D-RTRL is the full
  batched input tensor held by the executor.

**Transform hooks**

The primitive accepts two optional transform hooks in its ``eqn.params``:
``kernel_fn`` (computes ``y = conv(x, kernel_fn(kernel))`` — note the
kernel-facing name, not ``weight_fn``) and ``bias_fn`` (adds
``bias_fn(b)``). The forward impl, :func:`_conv_xy_to_dw` and
:func:`_conv_instant_drtrl` apply them; the eligibility trace and gradient
are always taken w.r.t. the **raw** kernel / bias, so the transform
Jacobian :math:`f'` enters *only* through the instantaneous rules via
:func:`jax.vjp` (``kernel_fn`` through a kernel VJP — applied per output
position in ``instant_drtrl`` — ``bias_fn`` as an elementwise per-channel
diagonal factor). The ``dt_to_t`` / ``solve_drtrl`` rules and the trace
initialisers are transform-free and stay exact (they operate on
:math:`\partial h / \partial K_{\text{raw}}`).

This primitive has **no fast path** — it always uses the generic rule path,
which threads :math:`f'` correctly when a transform hook is present.

    **Role in D-RTRL.** Implements the :math:`\mathbf{D}^t
    \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{t-1}` term of the trace recurrence. The trace
    keeps the spatial output axes (see :func:`_conv_init_drtrl`), so the

    No spatial sums appear anywhere — the spatial contraction with the
    learning signal is performed once, at solve time, by
    :func:`_conv_solve_drtrl`. (The old kernel-shaped trace summed
    :math:`D^t` over :math:`\mathbf{s}` here, turning the required sum of
    products into a product of sums — wrong for the kernel even at
    :math:`T = 1` and corrupting the bias recurrence for :math:`T \geq 2`.)

    **Role in D-RTRL.** Produces the

    **Kernel path.** Uses ``jax.vjp`` of ``jax.lax.conv_general_dilated``
    — the kernel genuinely depends on :math:`x`, so the full conv VJP is
    required. The remap ``strides → window_strides`` matches the
    low-level API.

    **Bias path.** The bias appears additively with no spatial coupling,
    so its instantaneous Jacobian is the cotangent itself at each
    spatial position. We store this per-position (no spatial sum here);
    the sum is performed inside :func:`_conv_dt_to_t` during trace
    propagation — this keeps the bias-trace shape identical to

    recurrence can be applied element-by-element.

    axis, so ``x`` may arrive as ``ndim == n_spatial + 1`` (no batch).

    The kernel trace keeps one kernel-shaped slot **per spatial output
    position**: the kernel is spatially shared while the D-RTRL discount
    :math:`\mathbf{D}^t` acts per output element, so a spatially pre-summed
    (kernel-shaped) trace cannot follow the recurrence exactly. The
    spatial-output axes come from ``y_var``'s shape via :func:`_conv_layout`
    (in y-array order); the kernel axes follow the raw weight layout. This
    costs :math:`O(B\, S\, |K|\, n_{\text{state}})` memory — for large
    convolutions prefer the IO-dim algorithm (``pp_prop`` /
    ``IODimVjpAlgorithm``), whose conv trace stays output-shaped.

    The bias trace keeps spatial dims so :func:`_conv_dt_to_t` can apply
    the per-position :math:`D^t` factor elementwise; the spatial sum
    implementing :math:`\sum_{\mathbf{s}} g_{\mathbf{s}} \partial
    h/\partial b_k` is performed at solve time by
    :func:`_conv_solve_drtrl`.

    The trace dtype is derived from the participating ``x``/``y``/weight
    avals via :func:`jax.numpy.result_type` rather than left to ``jnp.zeros``'
    default (which silently follows the global x64 flag instead of the

    batch dimension on ``x``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ArrayLike
        Input tensor with a leading batch dimension.
    kernel : ArrayLike
        Convolution kernel, with layout governed by ``dimension_numbers``.
    bias : Array, optional
        Bias added to the convolution output. A 1-D array of shape
        ``(out_channels,)`` is automatically reshaped to broadcast along the
        output's channel axis as determined by ``dimension_numbers`` (so it is
        correct for channel-first layouts such as the default NCH/NCHW as well
        as channel-last ones). An array of rank > 1 is added as-is and must
        already be broadcast-compatible with the layout-dependent output shape
        (this is how ``braintrace.nn.Conv1d/2d/3d`` pass their pre-shaped
        bias). Default ``None``.
    strides : Sequence[int], optional
        Window strides. Default ``(1,)``.
    padding : str, optional
        Padding mode (e.g. ``'SAME'`` or ``'VALID'``). Default ``'SAME'``.
    lhs_dilation : Sequence[int] or None, optional
        Left-hand-side (input) dilation factors. Default ``None``.
    rhs_dilation : Sequence[int] or None, optional
        Right-hand-side (kernel) dilation factors. Default ``None``.
    feature_group_count : int, optional
        Number of feature groups. Default ``1``.
    batch_group_count : int, optional
        Number of batch groups. Default ``1``.
    dimension_numbers : Any, optional
        Convolution dimension numbers (e.g. ``('NHWC', 'HWIO', 'NHWC')``).
        Default ``None``, which uses the JAX default layout.
    kernel_fn : callable or None, optional
        Optional transform applied to the kernel *inside* the primitive before
        the convolution, e.g. ``lambda w: w ** 2``. The derivative
        ``kernel_fn'`` is composed automatically via ``jax.vjp`` in the
        ``xy_to_dw`` rule so the eligibility trace is correct.
        The transform operates on the unitless mantissa; physical units are
        split off before and recombined after.
        Default ``None`` (identity, bit-identical to the pre-transform behaviour).
    bias_fn : callable or None, optional
        Optional transform applied to the bias *inside* the primitive before
        adding it to the output. Because the bias trace is per-position (the
        spatial summation is deferred to the solve-time contraction), the
        derivative ``bias_fn'(b)`` is applied as an explicit
        per-output-channel factor in the instantaneous rules (``xy_to_dw``
        and the D-RTRL ``instant`` rule).
        **``bias_fn`` must be an elementwise (per-channel) map**; the bias
        gradient is recovered as a per-channel Jacobian-diagonal factor via
        ``jax.vjp(bias_fn, b)(ones)`` and is therefore exact only when the
        Jacobian is diagonal.  Non-elementwise bias transforms (e.g. a
        per-channel softmax that couples channels) are not supported.  By
        contrast, ``kernel_fn`` is unrestricted — it goes through a full
        ``jax.vjp`` over the entire kernel.
        The transform operates on the unitless mantissa; physical units are
        split off before and recombined after.
        Default ``None`` (identity).

    Returns
    -------
    ArrayLike
        Convolution output tensor.
