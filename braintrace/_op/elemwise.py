r"""Element-wise ETP primitive — identity marker for diagonal weight ops.

``etp_elemwise_p`` is the only ``gradient_enabled=True`` primitive: the
compiler *evaluates* it when walking ``y -> h`` because its value flows
identity-like into the downstream consumer. The supplied ``fn`` is
applied to the weight by the user-facing wrapper *before* the primitive
binds, so the primitive itself is the identity.

**Forward operation**

.. math::

    y = \mathrm{fn}(w),

evaluated in Python by the :func:`element_wise` wrapper *before* the
primitive binds. The primitive body is the identity map on :math:`y`.
All non-linearity and broadcasting in ``fn`` are therefore opaque to
the primitive — what the ETP rules see is simply :math:`y` flowing
through, and :math:`\partial y / \partial w` has already been absorbed
into the upstream jaxpr by JAX's standard VJP machinery (because
``gradient_enabled=True`` tells the compiler to *descend into* this
primitive when composing Jacobians).

**Role of each ETP rule** (with :math:`y = w` in the primitive's own view)

* ``xy_to_dw(hidden_dim)`` — returns :math:`\partial h / \partial w` which
  for the identity is just the cotangent itself:

  .. math::

      \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial h}{\partial w},

  so ``xy_to_dw`` returns ``hidden_dim`` unchanged. This is the
  instantaneous :math:`\operatorname{diag}(\mathbf{D}_f^t)\otimes 1` for
  D-RTRL (no :math:`x` factor since the op has no separate input).

* ``dt_to_t(hidden_dim, trace)`` — elementwise product
  :math:`\epsilon^t = (\partial h/\partial y) \odot \epsilon^{t-1}`.
  The primitive is *diagonal*, so broadcasting is trivial: both trace
  and ``hidden_dim`` share the same shape.

* ``init_drtrl`` — weight-shaped trace :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon} \in
  \mathbb{R}^{\dots \times n_{\text{state}}}` (same leading shape as
  :math:`y`).

* ``init_pp`` — pp-prop df trace, same shape as ``init_drtrl`` since for
  an identity op the weight-shape coincides with the output-shape.

**Transform hooks**

The primitive accepts a single optional elementwise transform hook,
``weight_fn``, in its ``eqn.params`` (computing ``y = weight_fn(w)``; there
is no ``x`` input and no bias for this op). The eligibility trace and
gradient are taken w.r.t. the **raw** weight, so the transform Jacobian
:math:`f'` enters *only* through :func:`_elemwise_xy_to_dw` via
:func:`jax.vjp`; the ``dt_to_t`` rule does **not** apply :math:`f'`.

**Fast path**

A closed-form param-dim D-RTRL kernel bundle (:class:`FastPathRules`,
registered on ``etp_elemwise_p``) replaces the generic nested-``vmap`` trace
path with diagonal einsums. Because those kernels return the bare ``df``
(dropping :math:`f'`), the bundle's ``applicable`` gate disables the fast
path whenever ``weight_fn`` is present.

    **Role in D-RTRL.** Realises the :math:`y \to w` chain factor inside
    :math:`\mathbf{D}^t \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{t-1}` for an identity op.
    Because :math:`y = w` has :math:`\partial y / \partial w = I`, the

    .. math::

        \epsilon^t_{\text{pre}} = (\partial h / \partial y) \odot \epsilon^{t-1}.

    .. math::

        \frac{\partial h}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} \cdot \text{weight\_fn}'(w),

    computed via VJP. When ``weight_fn`` is ``None`` (identity), the
    contribution is simply the hidden cotangent itself.

    Because the op is diagonal, ``weight_fn`` is element-wise and its Jacobian is
    ``diag(weight_fn'(w))``. We therefore extract the per-element derivative once
    (cotangent of ones, shape ``(*w_shape,)``) and broadcast-multiply it against
    ``hidden_dim``. This is identical to ``vjp_fn(hidden_dim)`` in the unbatched
    case (``vjp_fn(c) = c ⊙ weight_fn'(w)`` for a diagonal Jacobian) but, unlike a
    direct ``vjp_fn(hidden_dim)``, it accepts a ``hidden_dim`` carrying extra
    leading axes (e.g. a batch axis under :class:`brainstate.mixin.Batching`),
    which the unbatched VJP would reject as a shape mismatch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : Any

    weight_fn : WeightFn or None, optional
        Element-wise function applied inside the primitive. When ``None``,

    Zero-initialised (matches :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^0 = \mathbf{0}`).

    Unlike matmul, the elemwise output *is* the weight, so ``y_var`` carries no
    batch axis. The trace, however, lives in the hidden-state (group) position
    space and acquires whatever leading axes the hidden state has — in
    particular a batch axis under :class:`brainstate.mixin.Batching`. The trace
    leading shape is therefore taken from ``group.varshape`` (which equals the
    y-shape in the unbatched / per-lane ``vmap`` case, and prepends the batch
    under ``Batching()``). This keeps the trace shape consistent with the
    instantaneous term ``df`` (shape ``(*group.varshape, n_state)``) so the scan
    carry stays well-typed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_var : Any
        Unused (``x_invar_index=None``).
    y_var : Any
        Output variable descriptor with shape.

        Dict with key 'weight'. Only its dtype is consulted (unused otherwise);
        falls back to ``y_var``'s dtype alone when ``None`` (e.g. direct unit

    num_hidden_state : int

    group : Any, optional
        The owning :class:`HiddenGroup`. When supplied, its (possibly batched)

    Notes
    -----
    The trace dtype is derived from the weight leaf and ``y_var`` (the
    hidden-group output) via :func:`jax.numpy.result_type` rather than left

    instead of the operands' actual dtype). ``x_var`` is unused here
    (``x_invar_index=None`` for this primitive), so it is excluded from the
