r"""General linear-in-weight contraction ETP primitive.

``etp_einsum_p`` marks a two-operand ``jnp.einsum`` whose second operand is
the trainable weight. The ETP rules are derived mechanically from the
equation by classifying each weight/output axis letter:

* **Diagonal** — in both ``w_spec`` and ``y_spec``: ``hidden_dim``
  broadcasts along the trace on these axes (dense-style).
* **Contracted** — in ``w_spec`` only (consumed by ``x``): free trace axes.
* **Shared** — in ``y_spec`` only (weight reused across them):
  ``hidden_dim`` is summed over them before broadcasting.

The batched equation form is required: the leading ``x``/``y`` letter is the
batch axis and must not appear in ``w_spec``.

Shared-axis equations are supported, oracle-proven exact for D-RTRL **when
the hidden state carries the shared axes** (its shape equals the einsum
output's, e.g. a ``(B, T, N)`` hidden fed by ``'btk,kn->btn'``): the BPTT
oracle confirms element-wise equality both for t-diagonal tails and for
tails that mix positions (each ``h[t]`` also seeing a mean over all ``t``).
This differs from pre-audit conv's inexact spatial sum: here every hidden
unit keeps its own trace column, so no per-position structure is lost.
When the hidden state does *not* carry the shared axis (output positions
collapse into the same hidden units — the conv-analog case), the
hidden-shaped cotangent cannot express per-position structure and the
algorithm fails loudly at compile time with a cotangent-shape error;
supporting it would need a per-position trace via
``ETP_RULES_INSTANT_DRTRL`` / ``ETP_RULES_SOLVE_DRTRL``, the pattern conv
uses.

    r"""ETP-aware two-operand einsum, linear in the trainable weight.

    Computes ``jnp.einsum(equation, x, weight_fn(weight))`` through an ETP
    primitive whose trace rules are derived mechanically from the equation's
    axis classification (see the module docstring): weight axes present in
    the output broadcast (*diagonal*), weight axes consumed by ``x`` are free
    trace axes (*contracted*), and output axes absent from the weight are
    *shared* (supported when the hidden state carries them, see Notes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    equation : str
        A two-operand explicit einsum equation ``'x_spec,w_spec->y_spec'``
        in **batched form**: the leading letter of ``x_spec`` must equal the
        leading letter of ``y_spec`` and must not appear in ``w_spec``.
        V1 restrictions: lowercase letters only, no ellipsis, no repeated
        letter within one spec, every output letter present in some input,
        every weight letter present in ``x`` or the output. Spaces are
        stripped before binding.
    x : ArrayLike
        The non-trainable operand, of rank ``len(x_spec)``.
    weight : ArrayLike
        The trainable operand, of rank ``len(w_spec)``. May be a
        :class:`brainunit.Quantity`; the units of ``x`` and ``weight``
        multiply into the result.
    weight_fn : Callable, optional
        Element-wise transform applied to the weight *inside* the primitive
        before the contraction. Its Jacobian is composed automatically in
        the weight-gradient rule.

    Returns
    -------
    ArrayLike
        The contraction result, of rank ``len(y_spec)``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the equation violates the v1 restrictions, or if ``x`` /
        ``weight`` rank does not match the equation.

    See Also
    --------
    matmul : ETP-aware dense matrix multiplication (rank ≤ 2 inputs).
    grouped_matmul : ETP-aware block-diagonal (grouped) matrix multiplication.

    Notes
    -----
    There is no bias parameter: compose with a plain add (a plain-add
    parameter is deliberately excluded from ETP by the selection principle)
    or use :func:`matmul` / :func:`grouped_matmul`, which carry one.

    Shared-axis equations (output axes absent from the weight spec, e.g.
    The ``t`` in ``'btk,kn->btn'``) are exact for D-RTRL when the hidden
    state fed by the output **carries the shared axes** (e.g. a
    ``(B, T, N)`` hidden state) — proven against the BPTT oracle. If the
    output's shared-axis positions instead collapse into a smaller hidden
    state (e.g. ``rec.sum(axis=1)`` into a ``(B, N)`` hidden), online
    learning fails loudly at compile time with a cotangent-shape error:
    The per-position structure required for the weight gradient cannot be
    recovered from a hidden-shaped learning signal.
