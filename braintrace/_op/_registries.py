r"""Global registries shared by every ETP primitive submodule.

The compiler and runtime treat membership in :data:`ETP_PRIMITIVES`
(identity-based) as the *sole* mechanism for recognising an ETP weight
operation, replacing the legacy JIT-name string matching. The four rule
dictionaries (``ETP_RULES_*``) hold every ETP-specific rule a primitive
needs.

Two boolean flag-sets — :data:`GRADIENT_ENABLED_PRIMITIVES` and
:data:`BATCHED_PRIMITIVES` — are maintained in lockstep with the
primitive set so callers can ask cheap per-primitive questions
(``is_etp_enable_gradient_primitive``, ``is_batched_primitive``) without
introspecting individual primitives.

Three metadata dictionaries — :data:`ETP_TRAINABLE_INVARS_FNS`,
:data:`ETP_X_INVAR_INDICES`, :data:`ETP_Y_OUTVAR_INDICES` — record the
per-primitive invar / outvar layout the compiler needs to locate the
weight / ``x`` / ``y`` variables on an equation. They are populated by
:func:`register_primitive` and queried through the accessor helpers
:func:`get_trainable_invars`, :func:`get_x_invar_index` and
:func:`get_y_outvar_index`.

One further metadata dictionary — :data:`ETP_FAST_PATH_RULES` — holds the
optional per-primitive closed-form param-dim D-RTRL "fast-path" kernel
bundle (:class:`FastPathRules`). Only primitives with an elementwise
``dt_to_t`` rule register one; it is queried through
:func:`get_fast_path_rules`.

Two further *optional* rule dictionaries —
:data:`ETP_RULES_INSTANT_DRTRL` and :data:`ETP_RULES_SOLVE_DRTRL` — let a
primitive override the param-dim D-RTRL algorithm's default use of
``xy_to_dw`` (instantaneous trace term) and ``dt_to_t`` (solve-time
contraction) when the trace structure it carries differs from its
parameter structure (e.g. LoRA's effective-weight trace). They are queried
through :func:`get_instant_drtrl_rule` / :func:`get_solve_drtrl_rule`,
which return ``None`` for unregistered primitives — the algorithm then
falls back to the legacy rules, byte-identically.

meaningful only if every trace slot has one well-defined hidden *position*
its instantaneous term lands on -- its **anchor** -- so that the widened

The anchor is a property of the primitive's **trace layout**, not of its
parameter: a spatially shared convolution kernel is still anchored, because
its trace keeps one kernel-shaped slot per spatial output position and
defers the spatial sum to solve time. ``etp_einsum_p`` with a *shared* axis
is not: its trace has no slot for the shared axis and ``dt_to_t`` sums the
hidden signal over that axis, so distinct shared-axis positions are already
collapsed into one slot and per-position influence is unrepresentable.
