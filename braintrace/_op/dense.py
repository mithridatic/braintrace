r"""Dense matmul ETP primitives.

``etp_mm_p`` is the batched primitive (``x`` shape ``(batch, in)``);
``etp_mv_p`` is the unbatched primitive (``x`` shape ``(in,)``). Both
optionally add a bias vector along the output dimension. The user-facing
:func:`matmul` selects the right primitive from ``x.ndim``.

**Forward operation**

.. math::

    y = x \, W \; (+ b)

where :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times I}` (or :math:`\mathbb{R}^{I}`),
:math:`W \in \mathbb{R}^{I \times O}`, and :math:`b \in \mathbb{R}^{O}`.

**Role of each ETP rule**

The four ETP rules implement the hidden-to-weight Jacobian pieces needed
by D-RTRL and ES-D-RTRL (pp-prop). For a primitive producing output
:math:`y`, let :math:`\mathbf{D}_f^t = \partial h^t / \partial y^t`
(diagonal approximation) and :math:`\mathbf{D}^t = \partial h^t / \partial h^{t-1}`.

* ``xy_to_dw(x, hidden_dim, w)`` — returns :math:`\partial h / \partial W`
  via the chain rule :math:`\partial h / \partial W = (\partial h / \partial y) \cdot (\partial y / \partial W)`.
  This is the instantaneous :math:`\operatorname{diag}(\mathbf{D}_f^t) \otimes \mathbf{x}^t`
  term of the D-RTRL update:

  .. math::

      \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^t \approx \mathbf{D}^t \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{t-1}
                                     + \operatorname{diag}(\mathbf{D}_f^t) \otimes \mathbf{x}^t

* ``dt_to_t(hidden_dim, trace)`` — multiplies the weight-shaped trace
  :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{t-1}` elementwise by
  :math:`\partial h / \partial y` (supplied as ``hidden_dim``). This
  realises the :math:`\mathbf{D}^t \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{t-1}` term
  *after* the executor has already contracted with :math:`\mathbf{D}^t`
  along the hidden axis, leaving only the :math:`y \to W` link to apply.

* ``init_drtrl(...)`` — allocates the D-RTRL weight-shaped trace
  :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon} \in \mathbb{R}^{\dots \times I \times O \times n_{\text{state}}}`.

* ``init_pp(...)`` — allocates the ES-D-RTRL output-shaped df trace
  :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_f \in \mathbb{R}^{\dots \times O \times n_{\text{state}}}`.
  In pp-prop, weight gradients are assembled at solve-time as
  :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_f \otimes \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_x`; the
  :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_x` factor is provided by the executor via
  :func:`xy_to_dw` using the stored :math:`x`-trace.

**Dict rule API (N-trainable-input refactor)**

Both primitives declare ``trainable_invars_fn``, which returns
``{'weight': 1}`` when ``has_bias=False`` and ``{'weight': 1, 'bias': 2}``
when ``has_bias=True``. The four ETP rules accept / return
``Dict[str, Array]`` instead of bare arrays so the executor can route
gradients to *both* weight and bias ``ParamState`` objects in one pass.

When ``has_bias=False`` the ``'bias'`` key is simply absent from every
dict, so the legacy (no-bias) code path is unchanged in behaviour.

**Transform hooks**

Both primitives accept two optional elementwise transform hooks in their
``eqn.params``: ``weight_fn`` (computes ``y = x @ weight_fn(w)``) and
``bias_fn`` (adds ``bias_fn(b)``). The forward and :func:`_mm_xy_to_dw` /
:func:`_mv_xy_to_dw` rules apply them; the eligibility trace and gradient
are always taken w.r.t. the **raw** weight/bias, so the transform Jacobian
:math:`f'` enters *only* through ``xy_to_dw`` via :func:`jax.vjp`. The
``dt_to_t`` rule does **not** apply :math:`f'`.

Both hooks are threaded through ``eqn.params``, which JAX treats as a
*static* (hashed-by-identity) part of the equation. Two textually identical
``lambda`` expressions are two distinct Python objects, so passing a fresh
``lambda`` each call (e.g. ``matmul(x, w, weight_fn=lambda ww: ww ** 2)``
inside a loop or inside a jitted function called repeatedly) silently
produces a cache miss / retrace every time even though the transform is
unchanged. Pass a module-level (or otherwise stably-identified) function
instead of a fresh ``lambda`` when ``weight_fn`` / ``bias_fn`` is used
inside a hot path.

**Fast path**

A closed-form param-dim D-RTRL kernel bundle (:class:`FastPathRules`,
defined as ``_DENSE_FAST_PATH`` and registered on *both* primitives) replaces
the generic nested-``vmap`` trace path with direct einsums. Because those
kernels emit the bare outer product ``x ⊗ df`` (i.e. the gradient w.r.t. the
*transformed* weight, dropping :math:`f'`), the bundle's ``applicable`` gate
disables the fast path whenever ``weight_fn`` *or* ``bias_fn`` is present.

    **Role in D-RTRL.** Implements the multiplicative step inside
    :math:`\mathbf{D}^t \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{t-1}`: the executor has
    already contracted the trace's hidden-axis with the hidden-to-hidden
    Jacobian, producing ``hidden_dim = ∂h/∂y`` (one slice per hidden
    state). What remains is the :math:`y \to W` chain factor, which for
    :math:`y = x W + b` is simply ``1`` on the matching ``out`` column:

    .. math::

        \frac{\partial y_{bj}}{\partial W_{ik}} = \delta_{jk} \, x_{bi},
        \qquad
        \frac{\partial y_{bj}}{\partial b_k} = \delta_{jk}.

    So the trace update along the :math:`y \to W` arrow is

    .. math::

        \epsilon^{t}_{W, bik} = (\partial h / \partial y)_{bk} \,
                                \epsilon^{t-1}_{W, bik}, \qquad

    **Two execution contexts.** Both arrive after the outer
    ``n_state``-vmap strips the trailing hidden-state axis:

    (A) trace update (batch retained):
        ``hidden_dim : (batch, out)``,
        ``trace['weight'] : (batch, in, out)``,
        ``trace['bias']   : (batch, out)``.

        ``hidden_dim : (out,)``,
        ``trace['weight'] : (in, out)``,
        ``trace['bias']   : (out,)``.

    **Broadcast rule.** ``jnp.expand_dims(hidden_dim, axis=-2)`` inserts a
    singleton at the ``in`` position in both contexts:

        (Out,)       → (1, out)       broadcasts with (in, out)         ✓
        (batch, out) → (batch, 1, out) broadcasts with (batch, in, out) ✓

    carries the influence of ``W[i, o]``, whose instantaneous term lands on
    output position ``o`` and nowhere else. The anchor is therefore the ``out``
    axis, unconditionally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eqn_params : dict
        The equation parameters (unused; the anchor does not depend on them).

    Returns

    bool

    r"""ETP-aware matrix multiplication.

    Computes :math:`y = x \mathbin{@} \text{weight\_fn}(w) \; (+ \text{bias\_fn}(b))`.
    The operation is routed through an ETP primitive so the weight (and
    optional bias) participates in eligibility-trace computation.
    Auto-dispatches to ``etp_mm_p`` (batched) or ``etp_mv_p`` (unbatched)
    based on ``x.ndim``.

    The eligibility trace and gradient are always taken w.r.t. the **raw**
    weight/bias before any transform is applied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ArrayLike
        Input array, shape ``(batch, in_features)`` or ``(in_features,)``.
        Higher-rank ``x`` (``x.ndim > 2``) is rejected with a ``ValueError``:
        Every ETP trace rule assumes one of these two layouts. For genuine
        tensor contractions use :func:`braintrace.einsum`.
    weight : ArrayLike
        Weight matrix, shape ``(in_features, out_features)``.
    bias : ArrayLike or None, optional
        Bias vector, shape ``(out_features,)``. Default ``None``.
    weight_fn : Callable or None, optional
        Elementwise, shape-preserving transform applied to ``weight`` *inside*
        the primitive: the op computes ``y = x @ weight_fn(weight)``. The
        eligibility trace and gradient are taken w.r.t. the raw ``weight``.
        The transform operates on the unitless mantissa; physical units are
        split off before and recombined after.
        Default ``None`` (identity).
        Pass a module-level function, not a fresh ``lambda``, if this is
        called repeatedly (e.g. once per step): ``weight_fn`` is stored as a
        static ``eqn.params`` entry hashed by object identity, so two
        textually identical ``lambda`` objects are cache misses and silently
        retrace every call.
    bias_fn : Callable or None, optional
        Elementwise transform applied to ``bias`` inside the primitive
        (``+ bias_fn(bias)``). Ignored when ``bias is None``.
        The transform operates on the unitless mantissa; physical units are
        split off before and recombined after.
        Default ``None``.
        Same re-tracing caveat as ``weight_fn``: pass a module-level
        function rather than a fresh ``lambda``.

    Returns
    -------
    ArrayLike
        Output array, shape ``(batch, out_features)`` or ``(out_features,)``.
