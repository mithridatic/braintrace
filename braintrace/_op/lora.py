r"""LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) ETP primitives.

``etp_lora_mm_p`` (batched) and ``etp_lora_mv_p`` (unbatched) compute
:math:`y = \alpha \cdot x \mathbin{@} B \mathbin{@} A` plus an optional
bias. The trace and gradient state are pytrees with ``lora_b``, ``lora_a``
(and optionally ``bias``) leaves; the originating ``ParamState`` holds
all factors as a pytree, e.g. ``{'lora_b': B, 'lora_a': A, 'bias': b}``.

**Forward operation**

.. math::

    y = \alpha \, x \, B \, A \;(+ b), \qquad
    B \in \mathbb{R}^{I \times r}, \;
    A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times O}, \;
    r \ll \min(I, O).

The intermediate :math:`z = x B \in \mathbb{R}^{\dots \times r}` is what
flows through :math:`A` to produce :math:`y`. Both :math:`A` and
:math:`B` are trainable; :math:`\alpha` is a scalar scaling (static).

**Role of each ETP rule**

Let :math:`g = \partial h / \partial y`. The chain rule yields

.. math::

    \frac{\partial h}{\partial A_{r,k}}
      \;=\; g_k \cdot \alpha \cdot (x B)_{r}, \qquad
    \frac{\partial h}{\partial B_{i,r}}
      \;=\; \alpha \sum_k g_k\, A_{r,k}\, x_i, \qquad
    \frac{\partial h}{\partial b_k}
      \;=\; g_k.

* ``xy_to_dw`` — VJP of :math:`y = \alpha\, x B A + b` over the whole
  dict ``{'lora_b', 'lora_a', 'bias'}``. JAX's autodiff delivers all
  three pullbacks from a single ``jax.vjp`` call. This **param-shaped**
  rule is what the IO-dim (ES-D-RTRL) algorithm applies at solve time.

* ``instant_drtrl`` / ``dt_to_t`` / ``solve_drtrl`` — the param-dim
  D-RTRL trace machinery. No :math:`B`-shaped ``(in, rank)`` trace can
  be exact: the hidden-to-hidden discount :math:`\mathbf{D}^t` acts on
  the *output* axis, which :math:`B`'s shape lacks (:math:`\partial h /
  \partial B` couples to the output only through :math:`A`). The trace
  stored under the ``'lora_b'`` key is therefore a **dense-style trace
  of the effective weight** :math:`W_{\text{eff}} = \alpha\, b\_fn(B)\,
  a\_fn(A)` of shape ``(batch?, in, out, n_state)``:

  - ``instant_drtrl`` adds :math:`x_i\, (\mathbf{D}_f^t)_o` to
    :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{W}` (the exact dense instantaneous
    term for :math:`y = x\,W_{\text{eff}}`), while the :math:`A` and
    bias entries reuse the exact ``xy_to_dw`` pullbacks.
  - ``dt_to_t`` scales *every* trace along the output axis by
    :math:`g = \partial h / \partial y` (the dense :math:`y \to W`
    link) — including the :math:`W_{\text{eff}}` trace.
  - ``solve_drtrl`` contracts the learning signal with each trace and
    chains :math:`W_{\text{eff}}` back to the raw factor:
    :math:`\nabla_B = \operatorname{VJP}_{b\_fn}\!\big(\alpha\, G\,
    a\_fn(A)^\top\big)` with :math:`G_{io} = \sum_t g_t^{(o)}
    \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{W,t}^{(io)}`. The chain is linear in
    :math:`G`, so applying it per step / per state / per batch and
    summing is exact for parameters held fixed over the gradient
    window.

* ``init_drtrl`` — allocates :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_W` of shape
  ``(batch?, in, out, n_state)`` under the ``'lora_b'`` key (the key
  keeps its name so gradient routing is untouched), plus the
  :math:`A`-shaped :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_A` and optionally the
  bias-shaped :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_b`.

* ``init_pp`` — output-shaped df trace; same as dense.

**Dict rule API (N-trainable-input refactor)**

Both primitives declare ``trainable_invars_fn``, which returns
``{'lora_b': 1, 'lora_a': 2}`` when ``has_bias=False`` and
``{'lora_b': 1, 'lora_a': 2, 'bias': 3}`` when ``has_bias=True``.

**Naming convention.** In this module ``lora_b`` is the *input-facing*
``(in, rank)`` factor (the first matrix applied to ``x``) and ``lora_a``
the *output-facing* ``(rank, out)`` factor — the classic LoRA-paper
:math:`B A` order for :math:`y = x B A`. Note that
:class:`braintrace.nn.LoRA` (following upstream ``brainstate.nn.LoRA``)
names its ``ParamState`` leaves the other way round: its ``'lora_a'``
leaf is the ``(in, rank)`` factor that flows into this primitive's
``lora_b`` operand, and its ``'lora_b'`` leaf the ``(rank, out)`` factor
that flows into ``lora_a``. Gradient routing is by dataflow (invar
position), not by leaf name, so the transposed naming is cosmetic.

**Transform hooks**

Both primitives accept three optional elementwise transform hooks in their
``eqn.params``: ``b_fn`` and ``a_fn`` (per-factor, computing
``y = alpha * x @ b_fn(B) @ a_fn(A)``) and ``bias_fn`` (adds ``bias_fn(b)``).
Note the per-factor names ``b_fn`` / ``a_fn`` rather than a single
``weight_fn``. The forward impl and :func:`_lora_xy_to_dw` apply them; the
gradients are always taken w.r.t. the **raw** factors / bias. In the
param-dim D-RTRL path, ``a_fn'`` and ``bias_fn'`` enter through
:func:`_lora_instant_drtrl` (which reuses the fused ``xy_to_dw`` VJP for
the :math:`A` / bias trace entries), while ``b_fn'`` enters at solve time
through :func:`_lora_solve_drtrl` via :func:`jax.vjp` (the effective-weight
trace itself is transform-free). In the IO-dim path all three Jacobians
enter through ``xy_to_dw``'s single fused VJP. The ``dt_to_t`` rule and the
trace initialisers are transform-free.

These primitives have **no fast path** — they always use the generic rule
path, which threads each :math:`f'` correctly when a transform hook is
present.

    :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_W` for :math:`W_{\text{eff}} =
    \alpha\, b\_fn(B)\, a\_fn(A)` (see the module docstring): since

    link is the dense-matmul one,

    identical to the (verified-exact) dense ``mm`` rule. The
    :math:`A`-trace keeps its exact per-factor recurrence — for
    :math:`y_k = \alpha \sum_r (x\,b\_fn(B))_r\, a\_fn(A)_{r,k}` the
    :math:`y \to A` link broadcasts :math:`g` across the ``rank`` axis:

    .. math::

        \epsilon^t_{A, rk} = g_k\, \epsilon^{t-1}_{A, rk},

    unchanged: a raw :math:`B`-shaped trace cannot be discounted
    correctly (the discount acts on the output axis :math:`B` lacks),
    which is exactly why :math:`\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_W` replaced it.

    routing both low-rank factors (and the optional bias) through an ETP
    primitive so they participate in eligibility-trace computation.
    Auto-dispatches batched/unbatched based on ``x.ndim``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ArrayLike
        Input array, shape ``(batch, in_features)`` or ``(in_features,)``.
        Higher-rank ``x`` (``x.ndim > 2``) is rejected with a ``ValueError``:
        Every ETP trace rule assumes one of these two layouts.
    B : ArrayLike
        Low-rank matrix :math:`B`, shape ``(in_features, rank)``.
    A : ArrayLike
        Low-rank matrix :math:`A`, shape ``(rank, out_features)``.
    alpha : float, optional
        Scalar scaling factor :math:`\alpha`. Default ``1.0``.
    bias : ArrayLike or None, optional
        Bias vector, shape ``(out_features,)``. Default ``None``.
    b_fn : callable or None, optional
        Elementwise transform applied to the ``B`` factor before the
        matrix multiplication.  ``b_fn(B)`` must return an array of the
        same shape as ``B``.  ``None`` means identity (no transform).
        The VJP of ``b_fn`` is auto-composed inside ``xy_to_dw`` so that
        gradients w.r.t. the raw ``lora_b`` weights are correct.
        The transform operates on the unitless mantissa; physical units are
        split off before and recombined after.
        Pass a module-level function, not a fresh ``lambda``, if this is
        called repeatedly: the hook is stored as a static ``eqn.params``
        entry hashed by object identity, so two textually identical
        ``lambda`` objects are cache misses and silently retrace every call.
    a_fn : callable or None, optional
        Elementwise transform applied to the ``A`` factor before the
        matrix multiplication.  ``a_fn(A)`` must return an array of the
        same shape as ``A``.  ``None`` means identity.
        The transform operates on the unitless mantissa; physical units are
        split off before and recombined after.
        Same re-tracing caveat as ``b_fn``: pass a module-level function
        rather than a fresh ``lambda``.
    bias_fn : callable or None, optional
        Elementwise transform applied to ``bias`` before adding.
        ``None`` means identity.
        The transform operates on the unitless mantissa; physical units are
        split off before and recombined after.
        Same re-tracing caveat as ``b_fn``: pass a module-level function
        rather than a fresh ``lambda``.

    Returns
    -------
    ArrayLike
        Output array, shape ``(batch, out_features)`` or ``(out_features,)``.
