"""Build shim that keeps the test payload out of the **wheel** but in the sdist.

All packaging metadata lives in ``pyproject.toml``; this file exists for one
reason only.

This project co-locates tests: ``foo.py`` is tested by a sibling ``foo_test.py``
(AGENTS.md rule 9), and the shared fixtures live in ``braintrace._testing`` and
in ``tests`` subpackages. ``[tool.setuptools.packages.find] exclude`` matches
*package* names, so it cannot see a loose module -- which meant every one of the
76 ``*_test.py`` files was copied into the wheel. Measured before this shim:
2.90 MB of uncompressed wheel content, 1.63 MB (56%) of it test code that no
installed user can run without pytest, hypothesis, and the fixture packages.

Two artifacts, two answers
--------------------------
The wheel is what users install; it has no business carrying tests. The sdist is
what downstream packagers (conda-forge, distro packaging) build **and run the
suite from**, so pruning it would take away their only way to verify a build.

Excluding at discovery time -- in ``pyproject.toml`` -- cannot make that
distinction: it happens before either artifact exists, so it hits both. The
filtering therefore lives here, in ``build_py``, which is the step that copies
modules into the build tree:

- ``find_package_modules`` drops co-located ``*_test.py`` modules and returns
  nothing at all for a test-only package, so neither reaches the build tree.
- ``get_source_files`` -- the list ``sdist`` builds its manifest from -- turns
  that filtering off, so the sdist stays complete.

This split only holds with ``include-package-data = false`` (set in
``pyproject.toml``). Left on, setuptools re-adds every file in the sdist
manifest to the wheel as *package data*, which put the whole test payload back:
Measured, 17 ``*/tests/*`` modules and all 9 ``braintrace/_testing/`` modules.
