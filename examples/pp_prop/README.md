# pp_prop Examples

A tutorial-linear walk through `braintrace.pp_prop` (aliases `ES_D_RTRL` /
`IODimVjpAlgorithm`) — an online eligibility-trace gradient estimator with
input-output dimensional complexity for spiking neural networks. Each file
is self-contained. Read them in order (01 → 16) to follow the companion
tutorial at `docs/tutorials/pp_prop.ipynb`.

## How to run

    python examples/pp_prop/01-basics-lif-integrator.py

The fixed examples run on CPU. The digit examples require the examples extra:

    pip install "braintrace[examples]"

Example 16 is a configurable scaling benchmark, so its runtime depends on the
requested neuron count and update budget.

### Configurable benchmark

Run an isolated fixed-work measurement:

    python examples/pp_prop/16-configurable-sparse-benchmark.py --neurons 131072 --degree 8 --updates 3

Measure the first validation checkpoint at or above 95 percent:

    python examples/pp_prop/16-configurable-sparse-benchmark.py --mode validation-target --neurons 4096 --target-accuracy 0.95 --json-output pp-prop-4096.json

Use ``--help`` to configure temporal steps, final supervision window, batch
size, optimizer settings, trace decay, evaluation cadence, sparse backend,
recurrent scaling basis, and resource limits. Each run uses a fresh worker
process and prints one schema-versioned JSON result. The default wall-clock
limit is 30 minutes. Progress goes to stderr.

Run on an accelerator, refusing to fall back to the host:

    python examples/pp_prop/16-configurable-sparse-benchmark.py --device gpu --neurons 131072 --degree 8 --updates 3

`--device` takes `auto` (the default: whatever JAX binds), `cpu` (pins the host
backend, so a GPU host can still measure the CPU arm) and `gpu` (requires an
accelerator). A `gpu` run on a host with no accelerator plugin exits nonzero
with `requested device gpu, bound backend is cpu` rather than reporting host
timings under an accelerator heading. Installing the CUDA plugin is what makes
an accelerator available; `--device gpu` only refuses to proceed without one.

This is a synthetic fixed-degree CSR classifier benchmark with trainable dense
input and readout projections. It is not a connectome-learning benchmark.
Time-to-target repeatedly checks the validation split and is therefore an
adaptive validation metric, not an unbiased held-out estimate. Reported memory
covers both sides of the device boundary: `peak_rss_bytes` is the highest 100 ms
sampled host process-tree RSS, and `device_peak_bytes` is the XLA allocator peak
live allocation, which is null on backends that report no statistics, the host
backend among them. The two are not comparable and neither is a total.

Cross-reference: for the `fast_solve` knob (shared with D_RTRL but not
required for pp_prop), see `examples/drtrl/11-knob-fast-solve.py`.
